1;"OBJECTIVE: To analyze the relationship between health conditions and weight changes among elderly people monitored by the SABE Survey over a ten-year period in São Paulo/SP. METHODS: This was a longitudinal study that followed (2000-baseline, 2006 and 2010) change in body weight (outcome variable) and associated health conditions (exposure variables) in the elderly (n=571); multinomial logistic regression analyses were employed. RESULTS: Average weight increase in the evaluated period was 29.0%. 34.0% (2006) and 12.5% (2010) lost weight and 18.2% (2006) and 39.9% (2010) gained weight. Prevalence of chronic diseases increased from 34.1% (2000) to 51.9% (2006) and 60.1% (2010). Older people with weight gain also rated their overall health as poorer in 2006 (RR:3.15; 95%CI 1.21;8.17) and 2010 (RR:2.46; 95%CI 1.02;5.94). The higher numbers of diseases (RR:2.12; 95%CI 1.00;4.46) and hospitalizations (RR:3.50; 95%CI 1.40;8.72) were associated with a decrease in weight in 2010. CONCLUSION: Weight changes are related to poorer health status among the elderly."
2;"OBJECTIVE: To analyze the frequency of sadness, nervousness, and sleep disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil, identifying the most affected demographic segments. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study using an online questionnaire answered by adults and elderly people to collect information on living conditions, health and health-related behaviors. Prevalence rates and prevalence ratios adjusted for age and sex were estimated. RESULTS: The data on 45,161 Brazilian respondents showed that during the pandemic 40.4% (95%CI 39.0;41.8) frequently felt sad or depressed and 52.6% (95%CI 51.2;54.1) frequently felt anxious or nervous; 43.5% (95%CI 41.8;45.3) reported the onset of sleep problems and 48.0% (95%CI 45.6;50.5) had a prior sleep problem that had become worse. Frequent sadness and nervousness, as well as change in sleep patterns were higher in young adults, women and those with a history of depression. CONCLUSION: The high prevalence found indicates the need to guarantee the provision of services for mental health and quality of sleep that are adapted to the pandemic context."

4;"OBJECTIVE: To analyze factors associated with the deaths of individuals hospitalized with COVID-19 in the state of Espírito Santo, Brazil. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study using secondary data. Logistic regression models were used to estimate crude and adjusted odds ratios (OR). RESULTS: As at May 14, 2020, 200 individuals had been discharged and 220 had died. Of the total number of people studied, 57.1% were male, 46.4% were >60 years old, 57.9% were cases notified by a private institution, and 61.7% had >1 comorbidity. In the adjusted analysis, hospital mortality was higher for the 51-60 age group (OR=4.33 - 95%CI 1.50;12.46), the over 60 age group (OR=11.84 - 95%CI 4.31;32.54), cases notified by public institutions (OR=8.23 - 95%CI 4.84;13.99) and cases with a greater number of comorbidities (two [OR=2.74 - 95%CI 1.40;5.34] and three [OR=2.90 - 95%CI 1.07;7.81]). CONCLUSION: Higher mortality was found in older individuals, those with comorbidities and users of public hospitals."
5;In view of the need to manage and forecast the number of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds for critically ill COVID-19 patients, the Forecast UTI open access application was developed to enable hospital indicator monitoring based on past health data and the temporal dynamics of the Coronavirus epidemic. Forecast UTI also enables short-term forecasts of the number of beds occupied daily by COVID-19 patients and possible care scenarios to be established. This article presents the functions, mode of access and examples of uses of Forecast UTI, a computational tool intended to assist managers of public and private hospitals within the Brazilian National Health System by supporting quick, strategic and efficient decision-making.
6;This article presents an experience report about integration between public and private health services, health service managers and the academy, for surveillance and control of the COVID-19 epidemic, in the municipality of Tubarão, Santa Catarina, Brazil. The city is home to a university and has a large flow of people from different parts of the country, as well as being one of the first municipalities in the state of Santa Catarina to report cases of community transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The measures adopted included the implementation of the COVID-19 Monitoring Committee, the Municipal Health Emergency Operations Center, and the COVID-19 Contingency Plan. After 100 days of pandemic, 5,979 cases had been reported, 431 (7.2%) had been confirmed, of which five (1.2%) died. Early decisions, such as the immediate suspension of business activities and crowded events, may have reduced the spread of the virus. The partnerships put into place have provided innovation and supported public service management in decision-making based upon scientific evidence.
7;"OBJECTIVE: To analyze the suicide mortality trend among Brazilian adolescents from 1997 to 2016. METHODS: This is an ecological time series study; Prais-Winsten regression was used. RESULTS: 14,852 suicide deaths were recorded, with mortality rates per 100,000 inhabitants of 1.95 in 1997, 2.65 in 2016 and average of 2.14 for the period 1997-2016; deaths predominated in males (67.59%), as well as deaths due to intentional self-harm (84.19%) and suicides at home (52.69%); the Midwest region had the highest rate in the period (3.71/100,000 inhabitants), in particular the state of Mato Grosso do Sul (8.3/100,000 inhabitants); the suicide trend rose 1.35% per annum in the general adolescent population (95%CI 0.56;2.15), 1.63% in males (95%CI 0.56;2.29), 3.11% in the North (95%CI 2.25;3.98) and 4.19% in the Northeast (95%CI 2.58;5.84). CONCLUSION: Suicide mortality in Brazilian adolescents showed an upward trend in the period studied."
8;OBJECTIVE: To describe lifestyle changes with regard to consumption of tobacco and alcohol, food intake and physical activity, in the period of social restriction resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study conducted in Brazil with data from the ConVid online health behavior survey. The data were collected via an online questionnaire answered by the survey participants. Post-stratification procedures were used to calculate prevalence rates and 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: 45,161 individuals aged 18 years or more participated. During the period of social restriction participants reported a decrease in practicing physical activity and an increase in time spent using computers or tablets or watching TV, intake of ultra-processed foods, number of cigarettes smoked and alcoholic beverage consumption. Differences were observed according to sex and age group. CONCLUSION: The results indicate a worsening of lifestyles and an increase in health risk behaviors.

10;OBJECTIVE: To describe the oral health care services for people with disabilities treated within the Dentistry for Patients with Special Needs (PSN) specialty. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study with data from the Program for Improving Access and Quality of Dental Specialty Centers (PMAQ-CEO) in 2014. RESULTS: Of the total of 932 services evaluated, 89.8% did provide care for PSNs, 30.4% had physical accessibility, 59.7% provided referral to hospital care and most guaranteed complete treatment. Only a third of the Dental Specialty Centers planned 40 or more hours a week for providing clinical care to PSNs. CONCLUSION: The care network for people with disabilities is being formed but, even with specific financial incentives, it has limitations. Services need to eliminate physical and attitudinal barriers to ensure universal accessibility. Protocols based on risk classification are necessary, prioritizing care at DSCs for complex cases not attended to in Primary Care and organizing the dental health care network for people with disabilities.
11;"OBJECTIVE: To analyze the temporal trend and describe the spatial distribution of Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) in Fortaleza from 2007 to 2017. METHODS: This was an ecological study using segmented temporal regression and thematic mapping. RESULTS: Between 2007-2017, 1,660 new cases and 97 deaths were confirmed. The overall incidence rate showed a rising trend (Annual Percent Change - APC=8.7% - 95%CI -3.3;34.1), while the mortality rate (APC=-25.9 - 95%CI -48.5;-10.6) and lethality (APC=-33.0 - 95%CI -53.7;-17.6) showed a falling trend. From 2010-2015 the incidence rate fell (APC=-15.8 - 95%CI -25.1;-4.0), but mortality (APC=18.7 - 95%CI 9.4;50.6) and lethality (APC=40.1 - 95%CI 22.5;72.0) had an upward trend. In 2015-2017, incidence (APC=-24.6 - 95%CI -36.2;-10.3), and mortality (APC=-44.6 - 95%CI -58.8;-17,6) fell, while lethality remained stable (APC=-13.5 - 95%CI -38.7;3.8). High incidence neighborhoods were clustered in the western region of the city, however, mortality and lethality did not present defined spatial patterns. CONCLUSION: VL is endemic in Fortaleza, although there was a reduction in the last three years studied."
12;"This article presents the history and construction of the National Health Survey (PNS) 2019, a household survey conducted in partnership with the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics. The objective of PNS 2019 was to provide the country with information on the health determinants, conditionants and needs of the Brazilian population. The expected sample was 108,525 households, considering a 20% non-response rate. The questionnaire had three parts, covering: (i) the household; (ii) all residents of the household, focusing on collection of socioeconomic and health information; and (iii) the selected resident (15 years old or more) for whom lifestyles, chronic diseases, violence, among other topics were investigated, as well as their anthropometric measurements (subsample). The information provided by PNS 2019 will serve as a basis for the (re)formulation of health policies, as well as support for existing actions and programs of the Brazilian National Health System."
13;"OBJECTIVE: To analyze the time trend and spatial distribution of transport accident (TA) mortality in Piauí, from 2000 to 2017. METHODS: An ecological time series study was conducted using Mortality Information System (SIM) data on TA mortality among people resident in the state of Piauí, according to sex, age group and municipality. Prais-Winsten regression was used. RESULTS: 14,396 deaths were recorded. The mortality rate per 100,000 inhabitants was 13.9 in 2000 and 30.6 in 2017. There was a significant increase in the TA mortality rate (annual percent change [APC] of 6.4% - 95%CI 4.3;8.7), being higher among motorcyclists (APC=14.7% - 95%CI 9.7;20.0) and among vehicle occupants (APC=15.2 - 95%CI 10.5;20.2). CONCLUSION: There was significant increase in TA mortality in Piauí, especially among motorcyclists and vehicle occupants. Actions are needed to promote road safety and to prevent road traffic deaths."
14;"OBJECTIVE: To describe medicinal plants used by people with tuberculosis (TB) in municipalities in Northern Bahia, in 2017. METHODS: A descriptive study was carried out with primary data on medicinal plants used by people with TB ≥18 years old, presented according to botanical nomenclature and frequency of consumption. RESULTS: Of the 80 people interviewed, 50 reported consuming some kind of medicinal plant; these were mainly male (34), ≥47 years old (22), of brown/black skin color (34), with up to complete primary education (25), married (26), not economically active (30), earning up to BRL 300/month (26), with coughs (33) and with no previous history of TB (44). Two species stood out in the citations, Chenopodium ambrosioides L. (worm-seed: 23 citations), and Solanum capsicoides All. (cockroach berry: 17 citations). CONCLUSION: There was widespread use of medicinal plants as a TB care practice in six municipalities in Northern Bahia."
15;"OBJECTIVE: To analyze association between prevalence and severity of dental caries and demographic, socioeconomic, behavioral and oral health status in adolescents. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study with secondary data on 5,558 adolescents examined in the São Paulo State Oral Health Survey in 2015. The zero-inflated negative binomial regression model was used, considering sample weights. Prevalence ratios (PR), ratios of mean (RM) and confidence intervals (CI) were estimated. RESULTS: Caries prevalence was 71.7%, and was higher in females (PR=1.09 - 95%CI 1.04;1.15), associated with being behind at school (PR=1.11 - 95%CI 1.03;1.18), dental calculus (PR=1.10 - 95%CI 1.01;1.20) and no access to fluoridated water (PR=1.21 - 95%CI 1.01;1.45). CONCLUSION: Identification of factors associated with dental caries can instruct the programming of health services aimed at controlling the disease."
16;"OBJECTIVE: To estimate magnitude and determinants of neonatal and postneonatal mortality rates in Goiânia, Brazil, 2012. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study based on data linkage of the Live Birth Information System and the Mortality Information System. Logistic regression was used to evaluate factors associated with neonatal and postneonatal death. RESULTS: Neonatal mortality (0-27 days of life) was 9.4 deaths per 1,000 live births; while postneonatal mortality (28-364 days of life) was 3.0 deaths per 1,000 live births. Neonatal mortality associated factors were: 0-3 prenatal care visits (OR=13.10 - 95%CI 7.48;22.96), 19-34-week pregnancy (OR=6.25 - 95%CI 2.26;17.29), birth weight <1,500g (OR=62.42 - 95%CI 22.72;171.48) and cesarean delivery (OR=0.54 - 95%CI 0.37;0.79). Postneonatal mortality associated factors were: 0-3 prenatal care visits (OR=4.16 - 95%CI 1.51;11.43) and birth weight <1.500g (OR=18.74 - 95%CI 4.04;87.00). CONCLUSION: A low number of prenatal care visits, premature childbirth and low birth weight were the main risk factors for neonatal and postneonatal mortality."
17;OBJECTIVE: To describe the profile of exogenous pesticide poisoning notifications in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, from 2011 to 2018. METHODS: This was a descriptive study of data retrieved from the Notifiable Health Conditions Information System. Sociodemographic, clinical and pesticide-related variables were included and presented in absolute and relative frequencies. RESULTS: 3,122 suspected cases of exogenous pesticide poisoning were reported. The main toxic agent was pesticide for agricultural use (60%). Spraying (42%) and dilution (18%) proved to be the activities with greatest pesticide exposure. Most pesticide poisoning occurred at home (59%), and accidental contamination (40%) was the main cause of poisoning. Most poisoning was of the acute single kind (82%) and clinical evaluation (61%) was the criterion most used for diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Most of records of exogenous pesticide poisoning in Rio Grande do Sul were related to its agricultural production model.
18;"OBJECTIVE: To assess the association between tuberculosis determinants and performance of directly observed treatment (DOT) under different levels of Family Health Strategy (FHS) coverage in Brazil. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study using data on tuberculosis cases notified between 2014 and 2016 on the Notifiable Health Conditions Information System, as well as data on FHS coverage in the municipality of residence. Logistic regression was used. RESULTS: 177,626 individuals were included; being an alcohol user (odds ratio (OR) 1.09 - 95% confidence interval % [95%CI] 1.03;1.16), being deprived of liberty (OR=1.21 - 95%CI 1.12;1.32) and positive sputum smear microscopy (OR=1.15 - 95%CI 1.10;1.21) increased the chances of DOT being performed . When stratified by FHS coverage, these associations became weak in the highest stratum of coverage. CONCLUSION: DOT being performed was associated with determinants of tuberculosis. However, association was not confirmed among residents in municipalities with higher FHS coverage."
19;"OBJECTIVE: To describe COVID-19 hospitalized health worker cases in Brazil. METHODS: This was a descriptive case series study; it included cases that became ill between February 21st and April 15th, 2020 registered on the Influenza Surveillance Information System (SIVEP-Gripe, acronym in Portuguese). RESULTS: Of the 184 cases, 110 (59.8%) were female and median age was 44 years (min-max: 23-85); 89 (48.4%) were nursing professionals and 50 (27.2%) were doctors. Ninety-two (50.0%) presented comorbidity, with heart disease predominating (n=37; 40.2%). Of the 112 professionals with a record of case progression, 85 (75.9%) were cured and 27 (24.1%) died, 18 of whom were male. CONCLUSION: The profile of COVID-19 hospitalized health workers is similar to that of the general population with regard to age and comorbidities, but different in relation to sex. The most affected areas were nursing and medicine."
20;"OBJECTIVE: To analyze the trend of leprosy indicators in Goiás between 2001 and 2017. METHODS: An ecological time series study was conducted. Leprosy morbidity and operational indicators were calculated using Notifiable Health Conditions Information System data. Prais-Winsten regression was used for trend analysis. RESULTS: There was a falling trend in the detection rate in the general population (Annual Percent Change [APC] = -6.8 - 95%CI -8.2;-5.4) and in children under 15 years old (APC = -7.2 - 95%CI -8.5;-5.9); a rising trend in the proportion of grade 2 disability (APC = 3.7 - 95%CI 2.0;5.3) and in the proportion of examined physical disability (APC = 0.6 - 95%CI 0.3;0.8); healing and examined contacts proportions were stable. CONCLUSION: Detection rates decreased while the proportions of grade 2 physical disability and examined physical disability increased."
21;"OBJECTIVE: To analyze the correlation between municipalities adhering to the Health Fitness Center Program, noncommunicable chronic disease (NCD) hospitalizations and socioeconomic levels from 2011 to 2017. METHODS: This was an ecological study; HFCP adherence indicators for 2,837 municipalities were calculated, as were NCD hospitalization indicators, according to funding categories and the Firjan Socioeconomic Development Index. RESULTS: The HFCP adherence indicator was higher for municipalities that received Congress funding (1.18), had moderate to high Firjan Socioeconomic Development Indices (0.94) and high NCD hospitalization indicators (1.03) (p<0.001). There were positive correlations (p<0.05) between the two indicators in municipalities receiving Ministry of Health funding (r=0.14) and those receiving both Congress and Ministry of Health funding (r=0.12); whereas correlation was negative in municipalities with moderate to low Firjan Socioeconomic Development Indices (r=-0.09; p=0.013). CONCLUSION: The main form of adherence to the HFCP, according to population size, was through Congress funding. Municipalities with poorer socioeconomic and NCD indicators had lower adherence to the HFCP."
22;"OBJECTIVE: To characterize tuberculosis cases notified at post-mortem in Brazil in 2014. METHODS: This is a descriptive study of tuberculosis cases notified at post-mortem. Data resulted from linkage of the Notifiable Health Conditions Information System-TB (SINAN-TB) and the Mortality Information System (SIM), and were described according to underlying cause of death: tuberculosis, AIDS and other. RESULTS: In the 2,703 tuberculosis cases notified at post-mortem, a higher proportion was found of people of the male sex (73.5%), aged over 39 (80.8%), <8 years of schooling (66.5%), of Black and brown race/skin color (62.8%), with the pulmonary clinical form of tuberculosis (75.2%); there was also a higher proportion of cases notified by the public health service (57.6%) and in municipalities with HDI-M >0.7 (66.6%). CONCLUSION: The characteristics described of people with post-mortem notification and the magnitude of this outcome suggest weaknesses in tuberculosis care and surveillance services."
23;"OBJECTIVE: To propose a list of congenital anomalies having corresponding codes in the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10thRevision (ICD-10), with the aim of applying it in health surveillance. METHODS: In December 2019, the following data sources were searched: ICD-10; ICD-11; anomalies monitored by three surveillance programs; and a database of rare diseases (Orphanet). Anomalies were retrieved from these data sources, processed to check for correspondence with ICD-10 and reviewed manually to compile the list. RESULTS: 898 codes were identified, of which 619 (68.9%) were contained in ICD-10 Chapter XVII. Of the 279 codes contained in other chapters, 19 were exclusive to the ICD-11 search, 72 to the surveillance programs, 79 to Orphanet and 36 to the search for terms in ICD-10. CONCLUSION: The codes contained in ICD-10 Chapter XVII do not capture the totality of congenital anomalies, indicating the need to adopt an expanded list."
24;OBJECTIVE: To compare primary health care (PHC) actions taken to care for chronic non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in the state of Goiás, Brazil, between 2012 and 2014. METHODS: This was a descriptive study using secondary data from the National Program for Improving Primary Care Access and Quality (PMAQ-AB). The proportions of teams performing actions to address NCDs were compared between PMAQ-AB cycles I and II using the McNemar test for paired samples. RESULTS: Seventeen of the 20 variables studied showed a proportional increase between the two cycles: from 16.0% to 32.1% of teams that practiced all care management actions, from 21.5% to 35.2% of those that practiced all health promotion actions and from 22.2% to 39.8% of teams that practiced all activities at school. CONCLUSION: PHC actions to address NCDs in Goiás were strengthened between the two PMAQ-AB cycles.
25;"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate prevalence and factors associated with service user embracement by Primary Health Care teams in Brazil. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study that included teams that took part in the 2012 National Program for Primary Health Care Access and Quality Improvement (PMAQ-AB) (Cycle I). The outcome used was 'user embracement by the health team'. The independent variables were macro-region, municipal profile, Gini index and Family Health Strategy population coverage, team meetings, study of spontaneous demand, consideration of user opinions and existence of continuing education. Multilevel Poisson regression analysis was performed. RESULTS: The sample consisted of 13,751 teams. User embracement prevalence was 78.3% (95%CI 77.6;79.1). In the hierarchical analysis, the highest prevalence of user embracement was found among Southern region teams (PR=1.37 - 95%CI 1.27;1.48) taking the Northeast region as a reference. CONCLUSION: There is an uneven distribution of Primary Care teams practicing user embracement in Brazil, possibly associated with regional inequalities."
26;"OBJECTIVE: To analyze the adherence of the population to physical contact restriction measures and the spread of COVID-19 in Brazil. METHODS: This was a web-based health survey carried out from April 24 to May 24 2020 using a chain sampling procedure. Intensity of adherence to physical contact restriction measures was analyzed according to sociodemographic characteristics, using logistic regression models to investigate associations with 'No/little adherence'. RESULTS: Of the 45,161 participants, 74.2% (73.8;74.6%) reported intense adherence to the measures. The group that did not adhere to the measures was characterized by men (31.7%), those aged 30 to 49 (36.4%), those with low education levels (33.0%), those who worked during the pandemic (81.3%), those resident in the North (28.1%) and Midwest (28.5%) regions of the country. In Brazil as a whole, there was a decrease in COVID-19 daily growth rates, from 45.4% to 5.0%. CONCLUSION: A large part of the Brazilian population adhered to physical contact restriction measures, which possibly contributed to decreasing the spread of COVID-19."
27;OBJECTIVE: To present the situational diagnosis of the leprosy laboratory reference network in the region of São José do Rio Preto, SP, Brazil. METHODS: This was an evaluation study with a descriptive design. The data were collected by means of an online form filled in by those in charge of the leprosy program in 2018. RESULTS: All 102 municipalities that make up the region provided the requested data, 82.4% (84/102) requested slit-skin smear microscopy and of these 68 received training. Of the total, 11.7% sent slit-skin smears to other laboratories outside the reference network. Only 57.8% (59/102) requested a biopsy, of these 47 had a doctor responsible for taking the biopsy sample and 31 did not send biopsy samples for analysis in the reference network. Lack of an adequate room, few trained professionals, absence of material for transportation and absence of printed test requisitions were described as aspects that hinder leprosy case diagnosis in the region. CONCLUSION: The laboratory network is fragile and needs to be restructured.

29;OBJECTIVE: To describe the profile of deaths and the lethality of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) due to COVID-19 in hospitalized children and adolescents in Brazil. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study conducted with data from the SARS notification forms of children and adolescents (0 to 19 years old) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Notifications with complete progression of SARS due to COVID-19 were included, up to the 38th Epidemiological Week of 2020. RESULTS: 6,989 hospitalizations were investigated, 661 died, resulting in 9.5% hospital lethality. Higher lethality rates were observed among children under 1 year of age (14.2%), female children and adolescents (9.7%), the indigenous (23.0%), and those living in rural areas (18.1 %), as well as in the Northeast (15.4%) and North (9.7%) regions of Brazil. CONCLUSION: Differences in hospital mortality were found according to sociodemographic characteristics and marked regional inequalities.
30;OBJECTIVE: To build scenarios and analyze the impact of social distancing policies on the spread of COVID-19 and the need for intensive care unit beds. METHODS: Three dissemination scenarios were built according to level of adherence to social distancing measures in the context of Brazil's Federal District, based on a dynamic transition compartmental model and Monte Carlo simulations. The model's parameter values were based on official sources, indexed bibliographic databases and public data repositories. RESULTS: The favorable scenario, with constant 58% adherence to social distancing, estimated a peak of 189 (interquartile range [IQR]: 57 - 394) ICU hospitalizations on March 3rd2021. Absence of social distancing would result in an unfavorable scenario with a peak of 6,214 (IQR: 4,618 - 8,415) ICU hospitalizations probably as soon as July 14th2020. CONCLUSION: The projections indicate the high impact of social distancing measures and emphasize the applicability of public indicators for COVID-19 monitoring.

33;This manuscript is related to the chapter about human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV) that is part of the Clinical Protocol and Therapeutic Guidelines for Comprehensive Care for People with Sexually Transmitted Infections, published by the Brazilian Health Ministry. HTLV-1/2 infection is a worldwide public health problem and Brazil has the largest number of individuals living with the virus. HTLV-1 causes a variety of clinical manifestations of a neoplastic nature, such as adult leukemia/T-cell lymphoma, and also of an inflammatory nature, such as HTLV-1-associated myelopathy, as well as other manifestations such as uveitis, arthritis and infective dermatitis. These pathologies have high morbidity and mortality and negatively impact the quality of life of infected individuals. This review includes relevant information for health service managers and workers regarding virus transmission modes, diagnosis, treatment and monitoring of individuals living with HTLV-1 and 2 in Brazil.

35;This article summarizes the chapter on epidemiological surveillance of sexually transmitted infections (STI) that forms part of the Clinical Protocol and Treatment Guidelines (PDCT) for Comprehensive Care for People with STI 2020), published by the Health Surveillance Secretariat of the Ministry of Health of Brazil. It presents some reflections on the new case definitions for surveillance of acquired syphilis, syphilis in pregnant women and congenital syphilis. The PCDT-IST 2020 was developed based on scientific evidence and validated in discussions with specialists. Epidemiological and clinical aspects are addressed, as well as guidelines for health service managers regarding programmatic and operational management of these diseases, guidelines for health professionals on screening, diagnosing and treating people with STIs and their sex partners, in addition to strategies for surveillance, prevention and control actions.
36;This article aims to present concepts and clinical practices recommended to approach people with an active sex life. These concepts are an integral part of the recommendations of the Clinical Protocol and Therapeutic Guidelines for Comprehensive Care for People with Sexually Transmitted Infections (STI), published by the Ministry of Health of Brazil in 2020.The article proposes a comprehensive approach to sexuality for health promotion and presents important aspects of the communication process that must develop clearly, without prejudice and judgment, with a focus on sexual and reproductive health. It also highlights relevant points about the exercise of sexuality at specific stages of life, recommending assessment of risks and vulnerabilities, as well as screening for STI and condom use. In this way, it is possible to contribute so that people can exercise their sexuality fully, responsibly and safely.
37;The Clinical Protocol and Therapeutic Guidelines for Comprehensive Care for People with Sexually Transmitted Infections, published by the Ministry of Health of Brazil in 2020, includes the update on acquired syphilis. The document comprises rapid tests use, safety and efficacy of the administration of benzathine benzylpenicillin, follow-up of cases, clinical and laboratory management of neurosyphilis, approach to sexual partnerships, assistance and monitoring of diagnosed pregnant women, and specificities of syphilis and HIV co-infection, as well as a summary of the notification of cases.

45;"OBJECTIVE: To analyze temporal trend and spatial distribution of syphilis in pregnancy and congenital syphilis in Goiás State, Brazil, between 2007 and 2017. METHODS: This was an ecological time series and spatial distribution study with data obtained from the Notifiable Health Conditions Information System. Prais-Winsten Regression was used to analyze indicator trends by health macro-region. Descriptive spatial analysis was performed to verify case distribution in three different years in the period. RESULTS: Between 2007 and 2017, 7,679 cases of syphilis in pregnancy and 1,554 congenital syphilis cases were reported. A rising trend was found in the rates of syphilis in pregnancy (annual percent change [APC] = 18.0 - 95% confidence interval [95%CI] 15.3;20.8) as well as in congenital syphilis rates (APC=16.8 - 95%CI 20.1;33.8); and a 326% increase in the number of municipalities with a congenital syphilis incidence rate >0.5/1,000 live births. CONCLUSION: Growth in syphilis in pregnancy and congenital syphilis detection rates was identified, as was growth in the number of municipalities reporting cases."
46;"OBJECTIVE: To identify socioeconomic and health care determinants of spatial variation in adolescent pregnancy in Brazil in 2014. METHODS: This was a spatial ecological study having municipalities as units of analysis. Spatial linear regression was used to verify association between the fertility rate in 15-19 year-old women and socioeconomic and health variables. RESULTS: The adolescent fertility rate was negatively associated with higher Family Health Strategy coverage (β = -0.011 - 95%CI -0.017;-0.005), an adequate number of prenatal consultations (β = -0.122 - 95%CI -0.132;-0.224) and low average family income per capita (β = -0.104 - 95%CI -0.105;-0.103). Association was positive in relation to the Gini index (β = 7.031 - 95%CI 4.793;9.269), low income (β = 0.127 - 95%CI 0.108;0.145), higher household density (β = 6.292 - 95%CI 5.062;7.522) and less schooling (β = 0.260 - 95%CI 0.224;0.295). CONCLUSION: Reduced access to primary care and lower income are associated with higher adolescent fertility rates. Poorer socioeconomic and health care indicators are associated with higher adolescent fertility rates."
47;"OBJECTIVE: To analyze agreement/discrepancy between body self-image and Body Mass Index (BMI), according to variables related to type of food and environment influence. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional analysis of 195 prepubescent children (≥5 years), attending a Primary Health Care service in Manguinhos, Rio de Janeiro. Z-scores were applied to classify BMI. Self-image was collected using the figure rating scale (silhouettes) validated for children. A multinomial model was used to estimate covariate association with the underestimated/overestimated BMI outcome in relation to self-image. RESULTS: Overweight children underestimated their BMI, as compared with self-image, more often (58.6%) than obese children (22.0%) and children with adequate BMI (49.0%). This dissociation was correlated to participation in a cash transfer program (OR=2.01 - 95%CI 1.04;3.90) and daily consumption of sugar-sweetened foodstuffs (OR=3.88 - 95%CI 1.05;14.39). CONCLUSION: Underestimation of BMI among overweight children should be taken into account by Primary Health Care services, in order to enhance intervention practices."
48;"OBJECTIVE: To analyze the prevalence of medication use, sources of access, and associated factors among rural residents in Pelotas, RS, Brazil. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study conducted in 2016 with adults ≥18 years old. Participants reported on medication use and sources of access to medication in the month prior to the interview. Poisson regression was used. RESULTS: Among the 1,519 respondents, 54.7% (95%CI 48.7;60.5) used some form of medication and 3.3% (95%CI 2.4;4.5) stopped taking necessary medication. Higher prevalence of use occurred in: women (PR=1.23 - 95%CI 1.12;1.34), the elderly (PR=2.36 - 95%CI 2.05;2.73), people with poorer self-perceived health (PR=1.29 - 95%CI 1.14;1.46) and people with a higher number of diseases (PR=2.37 - 95%CI 2.03;2.77). A total of 14.0% (95%CI 11.2;17.4) obtained medication exclusively from the Brazilian National Health System, prevalence of which was higher among those who self-reported themselves to be non-white and from lower economic classification. CONCLUSION: A low number stopped taking medication they needed to take. Use of free-of-charge medication was greater in groups with lower income."
49;"OBJECTIVE: To analyze association of different methods of gestational weight gain assessment with live births small for gestational age (SGA) and large for gestational age (LGA). METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study with adult women, normal prepregnancy BMI, single pregnancy and gestational age at delivery ≥28 weeks, from the ""Birth in Brazil"" study, between 2011 and 2012. RESULTS: Among the 11,000 women participating in the study, prevalence of excessive weight gain was 33.1% according to the Brandão et al. and Institute of Medicine (IOM) methods, and 37.9% according to the Intergrowth method. The chance of being born SGA in the case of insufficient weight gain was OR=1.52 (95%CI 1.06;2.19), OR=1.52 (95%CI 1.05;2.20) and OR=1.56 (95%CI 1.06;2.30) for the Brandão et al., IOM and Intergrowth methods, respectively. Likelihood of excessive weight gain using the same methods was OR=1.53 (95%CI 1.28;1.82), OR=1.57 (95%CI 1.31;1.87) and OR=1.65 (95%CI 1.40;1.96), for LGA respectively. CONCLUSION: Compared to the IOM recommendations, the Intergrowth and Brandão et al. methods show themselves to be alternatives for identifying SGA and LGA."
50;OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the predictive power of different malaria case time-series models in the state of Amapá, Brazil, for the period 1997-2016. METHODS: This is an ecological time series study with malaria cases recorded in the state of Amapá. Ten deterministic or stochastic statistical models were used for simulation and testing in 3, 6, and 12 month forecast horizons. RESULTS: The initial test showed that the series is stationary. Deterministic models performed better than stochastic models. The ARIMA model showed absolute errors of less than 2% on the logarithmic scale and relative errors 3.4-5.8 times less than the null model. It was possible to predict future malaria cases 6 and 12 months in advance. CONCLUSION: The ARIMA model is recommended for predicting future scenarios and for earlier planning in state health services in the Amazon Region.
51;OBJETIVO: To analyze the temporal trend of overweight and obesity prevalence rates among adults in the Brazilian state capitals and Federal District between 2006 and 2019. METHODS: This was a time series study using data from the Surveillance System for Risk and Protective Factors for Chronic Diseases by Telephone Survey, 2006-2019 (n=730,309). Prevalence of overweight and obesity for each of the years was analyzed, according to combined sex, age, and schooling. Temporal variation trend was analyzed using Prais-Winsten regression. RESULTS: Variations in overweight prevalence were observed, mainly among males 18-24 years old with up to 8 years of schooling (3.17%/year) and among women between 18-24 years old with more than 12 or more years of schooling (6.81% /year). Variations in obesity prevalence were found mainly among women 18-24 years old with more than 12 years of schooling (10.79%/year). CONCLUSION: There was an increase in overweight and obesity in most of the socio-demographic strata studied, especially among more educated young people.

METHODS: This was a descriptive study using secondary data from the Ceará State Department of Health and the state reference hospital. RESULTS: Of 171 cases, 75.7% occurred in males, 60.0% in <19-year-olds, and 56.0% in urban areas. Rabies was transmitted by dogs in 74.0% of cases, marmosets in 16.7% and bats in 7.3%. Between 1970 and 1978, there was an increase of cases (using the Joinpoint Regression Program, annual percentage change [APC] = 13.7 - 95%CI 4.6;41.5), while between 1978 and 2019 there was a decrease (APC = -6.7 - 95%CI -8.8;-5.9). There was a reduction in transmission by dogs (71 cases, last case in 2010) and an increase by sylvatic animals (5 cases since 2005). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates changes in rabies transmission dynamics during the period studied, with a reduction in transmission by dogs and an increase of transmission by sylvatic animals."
54;"OBJECTIVE: To analyze association between dental pain, use of dental services and school absenteeism in Brazilian adolescents. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study with data from the National School Health Survey (PeNSE 2015). The study's dependent variable was school absenteeism due to health reasons in the last 12 months. Socioeconomic characteristics, dental pain and use of dental services were the independent variables evaluated. Logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and respective 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). RESULTS: Data on 102,072 schoolchildren were included. Absenteeism prevalence due to health reasons was 53.7% (95%CI 53.2;54.3). In the adjusted analysis, there was association between dental pain and school absenteeism (OR=1.35 - 95%CI 1.26;1.45), and an increase in absenteeism occurrence the greater the number of dental visits. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that dental pain and frequency of dental visits may be related to school absenteeism."
55;OBJECTIVE: To assess the structure of primary health care centers (PHCCs) and the work process of primary care teams in child care in Brazil. METHODS: This was an ecological study with data from the three cycles of the Program for Primary Health Care Access and Quality Improvement 2012-2018, by states and regions. Seven structural and thirteen procedural indicators were analyzed. Student's t-test was used to compare indicator averages between regions. RESULTS: 85,845 teams participated in the three cycles of the program, grouped into 68,320 PHCCs. In the last evaluation cycle (2017-2018), mean percentage adequacy rates were higher among the structure indicators: health center operation (99%), equipment/materials (82%), vaccine availability (74%) and medication dispensing (70%). Population without coverage (68%) and making appointments with specialists (52%) corresponded to the lowest percentages of adequacy of process indicators. CONCLUSION: Process indicators had higher levels of adequacy than structure indicators.
56;OBJECTIVE: To compare Modality I and Modality II Oral Health Teams (OHT) regarding work process performance and differences between Brazilian regions. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study with OHTs that took part in the National Program for Primary Health Care Access and Quality Improvement (2013-2014). Latent Class Analysis identified OHT subgroups according to work process (action planning, health promotion actions and comprehensive health care) performance (consolidated, developing or incipient). OHT modalities were compared, resulting in an Index of Disparity. RESULTS: After evaluating 15,886 OHTs, Modality II OHTs were found to have a higher percentage of consolidated work processes in the Southeast (67.8%-94.6%) and Southern (54.8%-93.0%) regions. Disparity in the consolidated work process was greater among Modality II OHTs (6.3-26.5) compared to Modality I OHTs (3.9-18.4). CONCLUSION: Modality II OHTs have the potential for better performance regarding the work process, but with regional disparities.
57;"OBJECTIVE: To analyze association between presence of a companion during prenatal consultations and childbirth and quality of care received by puerperal women using the Brazilian National Health System (SUS). METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study with puerperal women who underwent prenatal care and delivery on the SUS in Santa Catarina State, Brazil, in 2019, and who were interviewed within 48 hours postpartum. Prevalence ratios were estimated using Poisson regression. RESULTS: 3,580 puerperal women were interviewed. In prenatal care, presence of a companion was positively associated with receiving guidance from health professionals (PR=1.27 - 95%CI 1.08;1.50) and building a birth plan (PR=1.51 - 95%CI 1.15;1.97). At delivery, presence of a companion was associated with greater receipt of analgesics (PR=2.89 - 95%CI 1.40;5.97), non-pharmacological pain relief management (PR=1.96 - 95%CI 1.44;2.65), choice of position for delivery (PR=1.63 - 95%CI 1.24;2.16) and less likelihood of being strapped down (PR=0.47 - 95%CI 0.35;0.63). CONCLUSION: Presence of a companion during prenatal care and delivery was associated with better quality of care."
58;"OBJECTIVE: To compare the structure and the work process in Primary Care for implementing medical teleconsultation in municipalities in different regions and with different population sizes (<25,000; 25,000-100,000; >100,000 inhabitants).

59;OBJECTIVE: To describe organ donations and transplants in Ceará state, Brazil, following the declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This was a descriptive study using data from the Brazilian Organ Transplantation Association. The number of donors and transplants from April to June 2020 was compared to the same period in 2019 and to the first quarter of 2020. RESULTS: In the first half of 2020, the state registered 72 effective donors, just 17 (23.6%) of whom related to the second quarter. Of the 352 transplants in the first half of 2020, 37 (10.7%) were performed in the second quarter. Compared with the period from April to June 2019, there was a reduction of 67.9% and 89.3% in the number of donors and transplants, respectively, in the same period of 2020. CONCLUSION: The number of donors and transplants in Ceará showed an important fall in the three months following the declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic, especially for kidney, heart and cornea transplants.
60;OBJECTIVE: To describe the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) projections for the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil and the Brazilian states, present their accuracy and discuss their implications. METHODS: The IHME projections from May to August 2020 for Brazil and selected states were compared with the ensuing reported number of cumulative deaths. RESULTS: The pandemic was projected to cause 182,809 deaths by December 1, 2020 in Brazil. An increase in mask use could reduce the projected death toll by ~17,000. The mean error in the cumulative number of deaths at 2, 4 and 6 weeks after the projections were made was 13%, 18% and 22%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Short and medium-term projections provide important and sufficiently accurate data to inform health managers, elected officials, and society at large. After following an arduous course up until August, the pandemic is projected to decline steadily although slowly, with ~400 deaths/day still occurring in early December.
61;"OBJECTIVE: To describe the process of Endemic Disease Control Worker (EDCW) integration into the Family Health Strategy. METHODS: This was a descriptive cross-sectional study. Data were collected through a self-administered semi-structured questionnaire, from February to May 2017, in four Family Health centers in the urban region of Campo Grande, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. RESULTS: 57 Community Health Agents (CHW) and eight EDCWs participated. All participants reported providing guidance to property dwellers and 58 carried out mechanical vector control during the inspection of properties, in order to avoid and eliminate possible Aedes aegypti breeding sites. With regard to EDCW integration in the Family Health Strategy, 18 participants highlighted teamwork as a positive aspect; while 15 highlighted lack of autonomy to undertake legal interventions as a negative aspect. CONCLUSION: EDCW integration in the Family Health Strategy is feasible, however, adjustments need to be made to optimize activities within the perspective of shared work in the same territorial area."

67;Descriptive epidemiological studies are of relevance, given that there are inconsistencies in the literature with regard to their nomenclature and classification. We reviewed 19 international and six national academic textbooks on epidemiology, where the main criterion was to have them available in order to undertake an in-depth review of chapters on descriptive epidemiology and study types. In 11 books, the authors prioritize analytical studies. Twelve foreign texts and two from Brazil include descriptive studies, although the majority did not specifically refer to a category with this name. We propose a classification based on the answers to research questions, including the following types of study: case report, case series, clinical cohort, prevalence study, incidence study (cohort) and descriptive ecological study. We discuss potential uses, implementation of novel data analysis methods and their relevance in health surveillance.

71;Pelvic Inflammatory Disease is a topic included in the Clinical Protocol and Therapeutic Guidelines for Comprehensive Care for People with Sexually Transmitted Infections, published by the Brazilian Ministry of Health in 2020. Pelvic inflammatory disease is an acute infection of the upper female genital tract due to canalicular spread of endogenous cervicovaginal microorganisms, in particular sexually transmitted organisms. Standing out among the etiological agents involved are Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The most important sequels are chronic pelvic pain, infertility and ectopic pregnancy. Clinical diagnosis is the most important practical approach. Antibiotic treatment should start immediately upon clinical suspicion. The article contains guidance for health service managers and health professionals on diagnostic tests, treatment, follow-up, counseling, notification, handling of sexual partnerships and special populations. In view of increased availability of the molecular biology technique in Brazil, C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae screening is recommended as a disease prevention strategy.
72;The topic of sexually transmitted enteric infections is one of the chapters of the Clinical Protocol and Therapeutic Guidelines for Comprehensive Care for People with Sexually Transmitted Infections, published by the Brazilian Ministry of Health in 2020. The document was developed based on scientific evidence and validated in discussions with specialists. This article presents epidemiological and clinical aspects related to these infections, as well as guidance for service managers on their programmatic and operational management.

73;"HIV infection is the subject of one of the chapters of the ""Clinical Protocol and Therapeutic Guidelines for Comprehensive Care for People with Sexually Transmitted Infections"", published by the Brazilian Ministry of Health in 2020. It is important that health professionals and managers learn the signs and symptoms of HIV infection and know how to diagnose it, in order to provide appropriate treatment and reduce complications. HIV infection has become a chronic disease and its treatment includes addressing common comorbidities in clinical practice such as arterial hypertension, diabetes and dyslipidemia, in addition to cardiac risk assessment, cancer prevention and guidance on immunization. Initiation of treatment for all HIV patients, regardless of clinical or immunological criteria, adopted by the Ministry of Health since 2013, has now been simplified with more tolerable first-line medications and with fewer drug interactions, which makes its management easy to implement, including by Primary Health Care."
74;This article addresses human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, this being one of the topics covered by the Clinical Protocol and Therapeutic Guidelines for Comprehensive Care for People with Sexually Transmitted Infections, published by the Brazilian Ministry of Health. The Protocol and Guidelines have been developed based on scientific evidence and validated in discussions with specialists. This article presents epidemiological and clinical aspects, as well as guidelines for health service managers and health workers about diagnosing and treating people with papillomavirus infection. This theme is an important public health problem, since it is the most prevalent sexually transmitted infection in the world, capable of triggering the oncogenic process of cervical cancer, as well as the possibility anogenital warts occurring. Important information is presented for gaining knowledge about HPV, as well as action strategies for infection prevention and control, provision of quality care and effective treatment of the disease.
75;This article discusses viral hepatitis, a theme addressed by the Clinical Protocol and Therapeutic Guidelines to Comprehensive Care for People with Sexually Transmitted Infections and, more precisely, by the Clinical Protocols and Therapeutic Guidelines for Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C and Coinfections, published by the Brazilian Ministry of Health. Besides the broad spectrum of health impairment, hepatitis A, B and C viruses also present different forms of transmission, whether parenteral, sexual, vertical or oral. Among the strategies suggested for the control of viral hepatitis, in addition to behavioral measures, are expanded diagnosis, early vaccination against hepatitis A and hepatitis B viruses, and access to available therapeutic resources. Considering vertical transmission of the hepatitis B and hepatitis C viruses, screening for pregnant women with chronic hepatitis B and C is an important perinatal health strategy, indicating with precision those who can benefit from the prophylactic interventions.
76;This article addresses vector, sexual and vertical transmission of Zika virus, a topic covered in the Clinical Protocol and Therapeutic Guidelines for Comprehensive Care for People with Sexually Transmitted Infections, published by the Brazilian Ministry of Health in 2020. Although in Brazil Zika virus is transmitted most predominantly by Aedes aegypti, the vertical and sexual transmission routes are of significant importance for reproductive health. Sexual transmission demands the use of specific prophylactic interventions, including the use of male or female condoms, especially among couples planning pregnancy. Vertical transmission is linked to severe structural abnormalities of the central nervous system and there is still no vaccine or known pharmacological resources that can prevent it. As the disease is predominantly asymptomatic, failure to comply with basic principles of care and guidelines related to the spread of infection transcends the severity of the symptoms of the disease.
77;This article addresses sexual violence, a topic that makes up the Clinical Protocol and Therapeutic Guidelines for Comprehensive Care for People with Sexually Transmitted Infections, published by the Ministry of Health of Brazil. Guidance is given to managers in programmatic and operational management with a focus on the service network for people in situations of sexual violence, recommendations to health professionals about prophylactic measures of pregnancy and viral and non-viral sexually transmitted infections, in addition to strategies for surveillance actions. Sexual violence is a broad problem that goes beyond the health field and involves conceptual and programmatic challenges for both health professionals, who are at the forefront of care for affected people, and for society, in terms of possible forms of prevention.

82;OBJECTIVE: To analyse how testing the population influences the health indicators used to monitor the COVID-19 pandemic in the 50 countries with the highest number of diagnosed cases. METHODS: This was an ecological study using secondary data retrieved on 8/19/2020. Cumulative incidence, mortality rate, case-fatality rate, and proportion of positive tests were calculated. The data were described and presented graphically, with their respective Spearman Correlation Coefficients. RESULTS: The testing rate varied enormously between countries. Cumulative incidence and the proportion of positive tests were correlated with the number of tests, while the mortality rate and case-fatality rate showed low correlation with this indicator. CONCLUSION: Most countries do not test enough to ensure adequate monitoring of the pandemic, and this is reflected in the quality of the indicators. Expanding the number of tests is essential, but it needs to be accompanied by other measures, such as isolation of diagnosed cases and contact tracing.
83;"OBJETIVO: To determine agreement between the Short Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults (S-TOFHLA) and the Short Assessment of Health Literacy for Portuguese-speaking Adults (SAHLPA-18) measurement instruments as a strategy for estimating concurrent validity. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study conducted with users of the Brazilian National Health System. An agreement approach using a weighted Kappa test for qualitative data was applied in order to test for concurrent validity. RESULTS: 372 individuals participated. It was found that 66% and 62% of them did not have an adequate level of literacy according to SAHLPA-18 and S-TOFHLA, respectively. There was strong correlation between the instruments (p<0.001; r=0.60), although the 65.3% agreement of correct answers found was considered weak (Kappa=0.35; p<0.001). CONCLUSION: The SAHLPA-18 and S-TOFHLA instruments have different constructs and poor agreement. Use of different instruments is indicated in research intended to measure level of literacy, as is the development of instruments specific to health conditions that allow results close to the real context of individuals to be obtained."
84;OBJECTIVE: To analyze aspects related to schistosomiasis positivity in an area of low prevalence in Brazil. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study, carried out in the first half of 2020, where we analyzed the proportion of positivity, according to the number of Kato-Katz slides, the diagnostic performance of the test and positivity estimates based on data from the Schistosomiasis Surveillance and Control Program Information System (SISPCE). RESULTS: 2,088 slides from 348 individuals were analyzed, with proportion of positivity of 11.8%, 26.7% and 31.0% for 1, 4 and 6 slides analyzed, respectively. There was excellent agreement (Kappa = 0.91) between the readings of 4 and 6 slides. The SISPCE data was estimated to be underreported by up to 2.1 times. CONCLUSION: Increasing the number of slides increased Kato-Katz positivity, which can contribute to maximizing the control of the disease as a Public Health problem.
85;"OBJECTIVE: To compare official mapping with probabilistic mapping of infestation by Aedes spp. in the municipalities of Rio Grande do Sul state, Brazil. METHODS: This was an ecological study using data from samples of mosquito breeding sites collected in 2016-2017; official classification was obtained from epidemiological reports, and infestation per municipality and week was estimated by fitting a dynamic site-occupancy model to data from municipal epidemiological surveillance. RESULTS: 187,245 samples collected in 473 municipalities returned 10,648 detections of Aedes aegypti, and 8,414 detections of Aedes albopictus; official mapping agrees with probabilistic mapping in municipalities in the northwestern and western regions of the state. The mappings are not in agreement in the eastern, central, northeastern and southern regions, revealing municipalities officially not infested but with high probability of infestation and notification of arbovirus infection. CONCLUSION: While official classification identified critically infested municipalities in the state's northwestern and western regions, it did not identify infestation in municipalities with possible false zero errors and where infestation varies over time."
86;"OBJECTIVE: To analyze association between exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) and the introduction of ultra-processed foods in children under 12 months old. METHODS: This was a Cohort study, conducted with children in Vitória da Conquista, Bahia, Brazil. The main exposure was EBF (days: <120; 120-179; ≥180). The outcome variable was the introduction of four or more types of ultra-processed foods in the first year of life. Poisson regression analysis was used. RESULTS: 286 children were evaluated, of whom 40.2% received four or more ultra-processed foods and 48.9% EBF for less than 120 days. EBF for less than 120 days (RR=2.94 - 95%CI 1.51;5.71) and for 120-179 days (RR=2.17 - 95%CI 1.09;4.30) was associated with the outcome after adjustment by socioeconomic, maternal, paternal and child variables. CONCLUSION: EBF for less than 180 days increased the risk of introducing four or more ultra-processed foods in the first year of life."
87;"OBJECTIVE: To describe the School Health Program (PSE) eye health action in Brazil, based on the PSE actions monitoring system. METHODS: This was a descriptive cross-sectional study using data from the Primary Health Care Information System from 2014 to 2019. RESULTS: data on 153,073 PSE eye health action activities and 5,697,109 participants were found. Activities increased by 65.1% in the period from 2014 to 2019. The average number of actions carried out in participating schools was 4.35 (95%CI 4.00;4.70). National average coverage of the action was 8.32% (95%CI 6.31;10.33) in the period. In 2019, 15,325 students were identified as having vision changes. CONCLUSION: We found that PSE eye health interventions have grown over the years in Brazil as a whole, therefore contributing to the prevention of visual impairment and blindness in Brazilian students."
88;"OBJECTIVE: To analyze vaccination coverage of children under 1 year old in the State of Roraima, Brazil, between 2013 and 2017, and show health professionals' perception, regarding the barriers that influence the achievement of higher vaccination coverage, 2017. METHODS: This was a descriptive study that analyzed vaccination coverage for bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), rotavirus, poliomyelitis, yellow fever, pentavalent, meningococcal C conjugate and 10-valent pneumococcal, based on data from immunization information systems. The barriers identified by the professionals were measured by a questionnaire with Likert scale answer options. RESULTS: BCG had the highest coverage (146.1%) in 2014; while Rotavirus had the lowest (70.4%) in 2013. Difficulty in accessing the internet was the main barrier (56/100) to better coverage identified by professionals working in the program (100 respondents). CONCLUSION: Low vaccination coverage reflects the influence of barriers to accessing vaccination."
89;"OBJECTIVE: To analyze frequency of condom use according to vulnerability factors for sexually transmitted infections in quilombola communities in Sergipe state, Brazil. METHODS: This was a descriptive cross-sectional study carried out in 2016-2017. A structured questionnaire with sociodemographic and behavioral questions was used; rapid HIV and syphilis tests were performed. Comparisons between categorical variables were performed using Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: Among the 367 individuals from 14 communities, the majority had low levels of education (72.8%), were not working (59.7%) and had a stable sex partner (90.7%). Lack of access to prevention supplies and information accounted for respondent programmatic vulnerability. There was a higher proportion of inconsistent condom use with a stable partner (90.1%) among individuals who reported lack of access to information (p=0.001) and inconsistent use with a casual partner (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: Frequency of condom use with a stable partner was significantly proportional to condom use with a casual partner and access to information on prevention."

METHODS: This was a cross-sectional population-based study using complex sampling with older adults. Polypharmacy was defined as concomitant use of five or more medications. RESULTS: Polypharmacy prevalence was 14.9% (95%CI 11.8;18.6), positively associated with females (OR=2.29 - 95%CI 1.41;3.74), white race/skin color (OR=1.61 - 95%CI 1.10;2.38), dependence (OR=1.65 - 95%CI 1.05;2.60), change in eating habits/dieting (OR=1.66 - 95%CI 1.16;2.36), hospitalization in the last 12 months (OR=1.61 - 95%CI 1.02;2.53) and presence of the following self-reported morbidities: systemic arterial hypertension (OR=2.40 - 95%CI 1.33;4.34), diabetes mellitus (OR=2.17 - 95%CI 1.23;3.84), osteoporosis (OR=2.92 - 95%CI 1.84;4.64) and heart problems (OR=2.94 - 95%CI 1.90;4.56). CONCLUSION: This study found that polypharmacy in the older adults was associated with demographic and health conditions."
92;"OBJECTIVE: To assess association between late-preterm birth and use of referral health services in the first year of life. METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study, with data collected from infants at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months old. Maternal and birth characteristics were compared between full-term and late preterm infants. The effect of late preterm birth on the use of specialized outpatient clinic, emergency room/emergency care center, hospitalizations and intensive care unit (ICU) admissions was evaluated by calculating adjusted odds ratios. RESULTS: 41 late preterm and 540 full-term infants differed as to frequency of low birth weight and in not staying in joint accommodation, both of which were higher in late-preterm infants, who were also more likely to be admitted to the neonatal ICU (OR=6.85 - 95%CI 2.56;18.34). Late preterm birth was not associated with the use of other referral health services. CONCLUSION: late preterm birth was not associated with greater use of referral health services after discharge from maternity hospital."

94;"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence of high cardiovascular risk (CVR), the proportion of people with high CVR who receive treatment and counseling, and to investigate the sociodemographic factors associated with this outcome, in Brazil. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study, using subsample data from the National Health Survey, collected via biochemical tests, in 2014-2015. Poisson regression was used. RESULTS: The proportion of high CVR in men was 11.2% (95%CI 9.6;12.9), and 10.4% (95%CI 9.2;11.8%) in women. In the group with high CVR, 68.8% (95%CI 63.7;73.4%) received counseling, 59.3% (95%CI 54.2;64.3%) received medication, and 55.6% (95%CI 50.4;60.7%) received both. In the multivariate analysis, receiving treatment and counseling was associated with being aged 50 years and over, and poor/very poor self-rated health (PR=1.26 - 95%CI 1.06;1.51). CONCLUSION: The proportion of people with high CVR who had received treatment and counseling was over 50%."
95;OBJECTIVE: To describe the profile of people who initiated HIV post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) in a public health service, evaluating the use of this technology by key populations as recommended by the Brazilian Ministry of Health. METHODS: This was a retrospective longitudinal study using secondary data on service users receiving care between 2015-2018. Absolute and relative frequencies were calculated and Pearson's chi-square test was used to compare behavioral characteristics. RESULTS: Of the 270 people evaluated, there was a higher frequency of young adults (45.4%), males (74.7%), people of white race/skin color (76.3%), with a high level of education (65.7%) and with multiple sex partners (40.7%). Among the key populations, there was a higher frequency of people who use alcohol and/or other drugs (49.6%) and men who have sex with men (38.1%), while transgender people (2.2%) and sex workers (4.8%) used PEP less. CONCLUSION: The use of PEP was not homogeneous among the vulnerable groups evaluated, with low frequency of transgender people and sex workers.
96;"OBJECTIVE: To investigate factors associated with the notification of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL), on the Notifiable Health Conditions Information System (SINAN) in Brazil. METHODS: This was an ecological study to estimate the proportion of municipalities that had notified NIHL. Logistic regression models were used to identify associated factors. RESULTS: Between 2013-2015, 277 (5.0%) municipalities notified NIHL. Notification was more prevalent among municipalities in an Occupational Health Referral Center (CEREST) coverage area (OR=1.62 - 95%CI 1.02;2.59) or those that had a CEREST in their territory (OR=4.37 - 95CI% 2.75;6.93), those that were closer to the state capital (OR=1.43 - 95%CI 1.06;1.92) and those with a high human development index (OR=2.35 - 95%CI 1.16;4.75). Among the municipalities located in a CEREST coverage area, notification was more frequent when there was a speech-language-hearing professional in the team (OR=1.96 - 95%CI - 1.47;2.63) and when employee turnover was low (OR=1.88 - 95%CI 1.40;2.52). CONCLUSION: Contextual factors influence NIHL notification, particularly the presence of CERESTs and their qualification."
97;"OBJECTIVE: To analyze association between climatic-environmental conditions and occurrence of compulsorily notifiable diseases and health problems, in the state of Espírito Santo, Brazil, 2011-2015. METHODS: This was an ecological study of municipality clusters calculated based on cases confirmed on the Notifiable Health Conditions Information System for the period 2011-2015. RESULTS: Notifications were more frequent among females (51.1%); people of brown race/skin color (31.7%); in the 20-49 year age group (48.1%) and in the Metropolitan Health Region (60.3%). The factors associated with health problems were ambulatory care sensitive conditions (p-value<0.001); education development index (p-value<0.001); temperature (p-value=0.019) and degree of urbanization (p-value=0.004). Diseases were associated with population density (p-value<0.001); temperature (p-value<0.001), humidity (p-value<0.001) and altitude (p-value=0.005). CONCLUSION: Health problems were positively associated with ambulatory care sensitive conditions, the education development index and temperature; but negatively associated with degree of urbanization. Diseases were positively associated with the factors mentioned."
98;"OBJECTIVE: To analyze the frequency and factors associated with recording deaths due to unspecified external causes in Brazil. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of Mortality Information System data for the year 2017. Univariate logistic regression was used to obtain odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) of nonspecific recording according to the explanatory variables - (hospital deaths and deaths certified by coroners). RESULTS: Brazil registered 159,720 deaths from external causes; 38.9% occurred in hospital, 83.4% were certified by coroners and 21.7% were from unspecified causes. Factors associated with the recording of unspecified external causes were hospital death (OR=2.00 - 95%CI 1.96;2.05) and the coroner's certification (OR=1.08 - 95%CI 1.04;1.11). CONCLUSION: The frequency of recording unspecified external causes is greater for hospital deaths than for coroner's certification."
99;"OBJECTIVE: To analyze association between social position and access to health services. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study carried out in primary health care centers in Salvador, Bahia, Brazil, where a project for improving accessibility was implemented. Pearson's chi-square test and logistic regression were used. RESULTS: 467 users took part in the study, 75.6% had not finished high school; 78.7% had <2 minimum wages; 51.8% had intermediate/qualified occupations. Low income was associated with starting to queue at the health care center the night before or before 8 a.m. (odds ratio = 2.09 - 95%CI 1.13;3.87) and spending more time scheduling an appointment (odds ratio = 2.13 - 95%CI 1.05;4.31). Having an elementary occupation was associated with face-to-face appointment scheduling (odds ratio = 1.68 - 95%CI 1.14;2.45). Education and social trajectory showed no significant association with use of health services. CONCLUSION: Social inequalities in access to health services remained after the intervention to improve accessibility."
100;OBJECTIVE: To assess the quality of triatomine identification in the laboratory network of the state of Pernambuco, Brazil. METHODS: The participating laboratories received support material with dichotomous keys and a panel made up of seven triatomine insects known in the Pernambuco, in order to identify specimen status on receipt (intact or damaged structure), as well as species and sex. RESULTS: Nine out of 12 laboratories took part of the study. The proportion of correct answers was 56/63 for sex identification, and 45/63, for species. The answers did not present a direct relationship with occurrence of damage to morphological structures during insect transportation. Panstrongylus megistus identification was correct for all specimens (9/9 laboratories), while correct identification of species of the Rhodnius genus was the lowest (3/9 laboratories). CONCLUSION: Despite the good performance in entomological identification, the weaknesses observed may guide improvements in the laboratory network and will be essential for Chagas disease vector control programs.
101;OBJECTIVE: To describe agreement between the Juarez System immunization data and information in vaccination record booklets and vaccination coverage in children aged 12 to 24 months. METHODS: This was a descriptive study to assess the vaccination status at 12 and 24 months of age of children born in 2015 and recorded on the Juarez System. The levels of agreement between the Juarez System data and the information in vaccination record booklets were verified. RESULTS: 429 children were included. It was found that agreement ranged between 84.1% and 99.1%. The vaccine survey found that coverage for each vaccine ranged from 86.01% to 100% and for the full schedule, from 77.1% (12 months) to 68.8% (24 months). The spatial distributions of vaccine coverage ranged from 28% to 100%. CONCLUSION: There was excellent agreement between the data, with high vaccination coverage, but heterogeneity in their spatial distributions.
102;OBJECTIVE: To analyze expenditure on psychiatric hospitalizations in the State of São Paulo in 2014 and 2019. METHODS: This was a descriptive ecological study, with analysis of data on psychiatric hospital admissions in the State of São Paulo, retrieved from the Hospital Information System. RESULTS: 115,652 hospitalizations that occurred in 2014 and 79,355 that occurred in 2019 were analyzed (reduction of 31.38%). There were reductions in the amounts spent on psychiatric hospitalizations (-42.94%), in particular expenditure on urgency hospitalizations, on female patients (-46.46%), on people aged 15-49 years (-36.85%) and on those aged over 50 years (-51.54%). CONCLUSION: The reduction in expenditure on psychiatric hospitalizations and the reduction in their frequency provide elements for the assessment and allocation of resources for mental health care, within the scope of hospital admissions and use of community-based services.

There was a higher risk of death among people over the age of 60 (PR=56.31 - 95%CI 34.24;92.61), multimorbidities (PR=3.63 - 95%CI 3.16;4.17), kidney disease (PR=3.42 - 95%CI 2.81;4.15) and neoplasms (PR=3.15 - 95%CI 2.41;4.13). CONCLUSION: The effect of social determinants and morbidities on hospitalization and deaths by COVID-19 is evident."
108;OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate of an instrument to evaluate interventions in relation to Health Promotion principles in Brazil. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of the development and validation of an instrument was carried out, based on the assessment of the first version by 20 health workers, the final version by 19, analysis of reliability by 31, and content evaluation of the first version by ten experts and of the final version by 12 experts. The content validity index, Cronbach's alpha (α) and intraclass correlation coefficient were used. RESULTS: The indicators achieved 89.9% adequacy, 82.5% clarity, internal consistency was α = 0.80, and the test-retest correlation was 0.93. CONCLUSION: The instrument showed acceptable validity and reliability and can be used for the evaluation of Health Promotion interventions.
109;OBJECTIVE: To analyze spatial distribution of tuberculosis in individuals under 15 years old and socioeconomic factors in Paraíba, Brazil, 2007-2016. METHODS: This was an ecological study based on data from the Notifiable Health Conditions Information System (SINAN), taking each municipality to be a unit of analysis. Spatial distribution of incidence was performed, the local empirical Bayesian method and Moran's I were applied. Socioeconomic data were crossed-checked to identify areas of social prosperity. RESULTS: 426 cases were notified, with average incidence of 4.5/100,000 inhabitants. Moran's I was 0.59 (p=0.010). The Moran Map revealed concentration of cases in children under 15 in 38 high priority municipalities, in clusters with high-high and low-low patterns, in the east and northwest of the state, coinciding with areas of low social prosperity. CONCLUSION: There were clusters with greater tuberculosis transmission, indicating priority areas for addressing tuberculosis.
110;OBJECTIVE: To describe cases of violence against people with disabilities notified by Brazilian health services between 2011 and 2017. METHODS: This was a descriptive study of secondary data on notifications of violence against people with disabilities recorded on the Notifiable Health Conditions Information System (Sinan). RESULTS: 116,219 cases of violence against people with disabilities were recorded in the period. Most of the victims were female (67%), White (50.7%), between 20 and 59 years old (61.6%) and mentally disabled (58.1%), with multiple disabilities occurring frequently (15.9%), especially mental and intellectual disabilities. Self-inflicted violence accounted for 44.5% of notifications. Physical violence was the most reported (51.6%), and in 36.5% of notifications the probable aggressor was a family member. CONCLUSION: The description of cases of violence against people with disabilities notified by Brazilian health services can contribute to the formulation and improvement of public policies to address this important problem.
111;"OBJECTIVE: To analyze association between patterns of food intake markers and high blood pressure levels among Brazilians. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study using National Health Survey data. Its outcome was high blood pressure levels, measured during interviews between August and November 2013. Food intake marker patterns were identified. These were the exposure variables. Prevalence ratios (PR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were calculated using multivariate Poisson regression. RESULTS: High blood pressure prevalence was 16.0% (95%CI - 15.3;16.7) in the sample of 37,216 participants. It was higher in those with a diet that included meat and alcoholic beverages (PR=1.21 - 95%CI 1.08;1.35). The pattern with greater presence of greens and vegetables did not show statistically significant association with high blood pressure levels (PR=0.94 - 95%CI 0.84;1.06). CONCLUSION: The pattern marked by meat and alcoholic beverages was associated with high blood pressure levels."
112;OBJECTIVE: To estimate underreporting of fetus and infant deaths having congenital syphilis as their underlying or associated cause in Recife, Pernambuco, Brazil, between 2010-2016. METHODS: Probabilistic database linkage was carried out between congenital syphilis cases recorded on the Notifiable Health Conditions Information System and fetus and infant deaths due to congenital syphilis recorded on the Mortality Information System. RESULTS: 170 fetus and infant congenital syphilis deaths were matched. Fetus and infant deaths due to congenital syphilis were underreported by 80.9% on the Notifiable Health Conditions Information System and by 7.0% on the Mortality Information System, accounting for an increase of 2.3% and 7.0% in the final databases, respectively. CONCLUSION: The underreporting identified compromises knowledge of the true magnitude of deaths caused by this disease.
113;"OBJECTIVE: To assess vaccination coverage, based on the National Immunization Program schedule, among children receiving financial support from the Family Income Transfer Program, Brazil, according to the family socioeconomic status and maternal characteristics. METHODS: 3,242 children under 12 months old were assessed between August/2018 and April/2019, of whom 3,008 were reassessed between September/2019 and January/2020. The analyses were performed using multilevel models (level 3, Federative Unit; level 2, municipality; level 1, children). RESULTS: Vaccination coverage was 2.5 fold higher in the first follow-up (61.0% - 95% CI 59.3;62.6%), compared to the second follow-up (24.8% - 95% CI 22.8;25.9%) (p<0.001). In the first follow-up, coverage was higher in the richest quintile (67.9%) and in children whose mothers had ≥9 years of schooling (63.3%). In the second follow-up, there were no differences. The highest coverage occurred between 0.5-2.5 (93.5%) and 12.5-15.5 months (34.4%), respectively, first and second follow-ups. CONCLUSION: Low coverage was found, both in the first and second year of life."
114;OBJECTIVE: To describe the epidemiological profile of pregnant women with suspected Zika virus infection, reported on the Center for Strategic Information for Health Surveillance System, in the state of São Paulo, Brazil, its range of abnormalities and/or pregnancy outcomes. METHODS: Descriptive epidemiological study of a cohort of symptomatic pregnant women with suspected Zika virus infection and their pregnancy outcomes, living in the state of São Paulo, reported between 2015-2018. RESULTS: Of the 2,329 pregnant women studied, 29.3% were confirmed to have the infection, almost half of them were single (44.8%), the majority of them were white woman (74.2%), with complete high school education (53.6%), and concentrated in the northeast region of the state. The proportion of newborns with central nervous system abnormalities was approximately 4.0%. CONCLUSION: The results found characterize Zika virus transmission in the state of São Paulo and may support public health actions in places with higher risk of disease transmission.
115;"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of catastrophic costs on unfavorable tuberculosis treatment outcomes. METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study, conducted in five Brazilian state capitals (Manaus, Recife, Vitória, Campo Grande and Porto Alegre) from June 2016 to July 2018. Logistic regression was used to calculate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). RESULTS: Of the 350 participants, 310 were included, of whom 30 presented unfavorable outcomes. Catastrophic cost (OR=2.53 -95% CI 1.13;5.67) and divorce (OR=5.29 -95% CI 1.39;20.05) increased the chances of unfavorable outcomes. CONCLUSION: Financial difficulties during tuberculosis treatment may impair its outcome. Catastrophic cost and divorce were determining factors for treatment outcomes."
116;"OBJECTIVE: To analyze health service utilization and associated factors among university students. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study conducted with a sample of 2,708 students at the Federal University of Pelotas between November 2017 and July 2018. RESULTS: Of the 1,865 individuals included in the study, 55.8% used health services in the last 12 months, 39.3% used specialized services, and 22.6% used health centers; 45.9% used services funded by the Brazilian National Health System (SUS); 49.1% used health services for the purposes of prevention. There was greater use among females (prevalence ratio, PR=1.34 - 95%CI 1.23;1.46) and students with health needs (PR=1.51 - 95%CI 1.40;1.63). Greater association was found with SUS-funded services: primary health care center (83.0% [95%CI 77.3;87.5]), accident and emergency (81.3% [95%CI 73.2;87.5]) and urgent care center (83.6% [95%CI 76.2;89.0]). CONCLUSION: The analysis indicated that women and people with health needs use health services more and that the SUS is the main service provider."

RESULTS: Se The prevalence of overweight was 55.9% (95%CI 54.9;56.9), associated in men with age of 35-44 years (PR=1.87 - 95%CI 1.65;2.12), alcohol consumption (PR=1.09 - 95%CI 1.03;1.15), and hypertension (PR=1.24 - 95%CI 1.17;1.31); and in women, associated to age 45-54 years (PR=2.03 - 95%CI 1.77;2.32), habit of watching television for 3h/day (PR=1.09 - 95%CI 1.04;1.15), and poor/very poor health status (PR=1.31 - 95%CI 1.20;1.43). CONCLUSION: Se Overweight was observed in more than half of the sample, associated with hypertension, diabetes mellitus and alcohol consumption, in both sexes."
118;OBJECTIVE: To assess health care for people with diabetes and hypertension, comparing the teams according to their participation in both cycles I and II of the Program for Improving Primary Health Care Access and Quality (PMAQ), and to verify its association with the characteristics of service users and municipalities. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study using PMAQ data from 2014. The following variables were used: team organization, request for tests and health care reported by service users. RESULTS: Thirty-five percent of the teams presented adequate organization and 88% requested all tests. Among the users, 31% had their feet examined and 18% received adequate health care. Municipalities in the Southeast region, with more than 300,000 inhabitants and the highest human development index, presented the best indicators. The teams that took part in both cycles I and II showed greater prevalence of organization and request for tests. CONCLUSION: Health care for people with diabetes and hypertension in primary health care in Brazil needs improvement.
119;"OBJECTIVE: To investigate factors associated with non-access to oral health in Brazil. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of data from external evaluations of the National Primary Care Access and Quality Improvement Program (2014 and 2018), using hierarchical multivariate logistic regression. 'Non-access' was defined as the service user not being able to make an appointment with a dentist. RESULTS: We analyzed data on 37.262 individuals (2014 sample) and on a further 117.570 individuals (2018 sample). Greater likelihood of non-access was found for those who live in municipalities with greater inequalities and with less oral health coverage, those whose travel time to the health center is more than 11 minutes, being female, being aged between 25 and 39 years and those whose income was up to 1 minimum wage. CONCLUSION: Non-access was associated with municipal factors such as greater inequality; organizational factors such as less oral health coverage and travel time to the health center; and individual factors such as sex, age and income."
120;"OBJECTIVE: To analyze trends in the prevalence of overweight and obesity in the state of Espírito Santo, Brazil, between 2009 and 2018. METHODS: This was an ecological study, with data from the Food and Nutritional Surveillance System (SISVAN). Overweight and obesity were classified as recommended by the World Health Organization. Prais-Winsten regression was used to estimate the trend of the prevalence. RESULTS: There was an increasing trend of overweight (5.5 to 8.6%) and obesity (4.4 to 8.3%), in both sexes and in different regions of the state. In the stratified analysis, there was an increase in overweight and obesity in children, adolescents and adult women (4.2 to 8.6%; p<0.05). Obesity increased among male adolescents, in the south, central and north regions of the state, while in the south region, in all age groups (5.1% growth; p=0.01). CONCLUSION: There was an increase in overweight and obesity in Espírito Santo, from 2009 to 2018."
121;"OBJECTIVE: To analyze risk factors for death in individuals with severe acute respiratory syndrome due to COVID-19. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study, comprised of adult individuals with COVID-19, from March to September 2020, notified by the Epidemiological Surveillance System in the state of Acre, Brazil. Cox regression was used. RESULTS: Among 57,700 individuals analyzed, the incidence was 2,765.4/100,000 inhabitants, and mortality was, 61.8/100,000 inhabitants. The risk factors for death were: being male (HR=1.48 -95% CI 1.25;1.76), age ≥60 years (HR=10.64 -95% CI 8.84;12.81), symptom of dyspnea (HR=4.20 -95% CI 3.44;5.12) and multimorbidity (HR=2.23 -95% CI 1.77;2.81), with emphasis on heart disease and diabetes mellitus. 'Sore throat' and 'headache' were symptoms present in mild cases of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Being male, elderly, having heart disease, diabetes mellitus and dyspnea were characteristics associated with death due to COVID-19."
122;OBJECTIVE: To describe the adequacy of immunobiological agent conservation in vaccination rooms in the municipalities of the Western health macro-region of the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. METHODS: This was a descriptive study, based on a validated scale, with a maximum score of 15 points. A descriptive analysis and an association test between the scores obtained by the municipalities and variables of the external context were performed. RESULTS: 275 out of a total of 295 existing vaccination rooms were evaluated. Immunobiological agent conservation in the West macro-region obtained an average score of 4 points (standard score, 0 to 15). There was a poor availability of immunization supplies aimed at immunobiological agent conservation, and work processes, that require improvement. Small municipalities presented better immunobiological agent conservation (p=0.011). CONCLUSION: Immunobiological agent conservation in vaccination rooms in the Western health macro-region of Minas Gerais State was considered inadequate.
123;"OBJECTIVE: To analyze the association among social and health inequalities, socioeconomic status, spatial segregation and Case Fatality Rate (CFR) due to COVID-19 in Fortaleza, the state capital of Ceará, Brazil. METHODS: This was an ecological study of confirmed cases and deaths due to COVID-19. The 119 neighborhoods of Fortaleza were used as units of analysis. Incidence, mortality and apparent CFR indicators due to COVID-19 were calculated between January 1 and June 8, 2020. Socioeconomic indicators were obtained from the 2010 Brazilian Demographic Census. Spatial analysis was performed and local and global Moran's indexes were calculated. RESULTS: There were 22,830 confirmed cases, 2,333 deaths and the apparent CFR was 12.7% (95% CI 11.6;13.9). Significant spatial autocorrelations between apparent CFR (I=0.35) and extreme poverty (I=0.51), overlapping in several neighborhoods of the city, were found. CONCLUSION: The apparent CFR due to COVID-19 is associated with the worst socioeconomic and health status, which shows the relationship between social inequalities and health outcomes in times of pandemic."
124;"OBJECTIVE: To analyze the prevalence of abdominal obesity and associated factors in quilombola communities in Northern Minas Gerais, Brazil. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study conducted in 2019 through structured interviews and waist circumference measurement; Poisson regression was used, separated by gender, to calculate prevalence ratios (PR) of abdominal obesity adjusted by independent variables and 95% confidence interval (95%CI). RESULTS: 56.6% (95% CI 50.9;62.0) of the observed quilombolas presented abdominal obesity; in the adjusted analysis, among men, there was an association of the outcome with age ≥60 years old (60-69 years old: PR=2.52 - CI95% 1.33; 4.75), not being a smoker (PR=1.73 - 95%CI 1.17;2.55) and reported arterial hypertension (PR=1.42 - 95%CI 1.11;1.80), while in women, it was associated with age ≥50 years old (50-59 years old: PR=1.25 - 95% CI 1.01;1.54), smoking cessation (PR=1.26 - 95% CI 1.00; 1.58), consumption of chicken with skin (PR=1.09 - 95% CI 1.00;1.19) and hypertension (PR=1.22 - 95% CI 1.11;1.36). CONCLUSION: There was high prevalence of abdominal obesity among quilombolas. It was higher in the elderly, smokers, former smokers and those with hypertension."
125;"OBJECTIVE: To analyze the effect of sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of new leprosy cases as determinants in the performance of the evaluation of their contacts. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study, with a temporal approach to the evaluation indicator of 100% of contacts examined of each new case (NC) registered in the state of Ceará, Brazil, on the Notifiable Diseases Information System (SINAN), in 2008-2019. Logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). The temporal trends were analyzed using joinpoint regression. RESULTS: 23,675 NCs, 65.4% with contacts examined were analyzed. It was less likely to evaluate 100% of the registered contacts when the new cases were multibacillary (OR=1.19 - 95%CI 1.11;1.28) and with examination of contacts as an entry mode (OR=1.71 - 95%CI 1.35;2.18). There was an increasing temporal trend of the indicator (Annual Percentage Change: 2.1 - 95%CI 1.2;3.0). CONCLUSION: Distinct dimensions of individual and social vulnerability among new leprosy cases influenced the persistent unsatisfactory performance of the evaluation of contacts."

132;OBJECTIVE: To analyze self-reported sociodemographic and clinical characteristics among individuals aged 2 to 22 years and possible associations with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Espírito Santo, Brazil. METHODS: This was a serial cross-sectional population-based study carried out from May to June 2020. The COVID-19 positivity rate was assessed by serological testing, and associated factors were assessed using Pearson's chi-square test (5% significance level). RESULTS: Among 1,693 individuals aged 2 to 22 years, 6.1% tested positive for COVID-19 and, among these, 35.5% did not present any symptoms. Differences were identified between positive and negative cases regarding the number of symptoms (p-value=0.001).Coughing was reported by 40.4% of positive individuals. Only 14.3% sought health care, namely 29.8% among those who tested positive and 13.3% among those who tested negative (p-value=0.001). CONCLUSION: The percentage of asymptomatic patients can impact the COVID-19 transmission chain in schools and fuel outbreaks of the disease in schools.
133;"OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence of postpartum depression symptoms among puerperal women and their association with violence. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study with puerperal women cared for at a public maternity hospital in Cariacica, ES, Brazil, in 2017. A questionnaire prepared by the authors and validated instruments were used. Pearson's chi-square test was performed in the analysis and association was expressed in prevalence ratios (PR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). RESULTS: Postpartum depression symptom prevalence was 36.7% (95%CI 31.6;42.0). Total family income was inversely associated with this prevalence (p<0.05). Mothers who were single (PR=1.75 - 95%CI 1.17;2.64), wished to abort (PR=1.96 - 95%CI 1.50;2.56), drank alcohol during pregnancy (PR=1.37 - 95%CI 1.00;1.86), experienced intimate partner violence in their lifetime (PR=1.94 - 95%CI 1.38;2.73), and during pregnancy (PR=1.41 - 95%CI 1.07;1.85), had higher prevalence of depression symptoms. CONCLUSION: Postpartum depression symptoms are associated with marital status, wanting to abort, alcohol consumption during pregnancy and intimate partner violence."

135;OBJECTIVE: To explore the reorganization of the health system in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We conducted an ecological, descriptive-exploratory study with analysis of spatio-temporal clusters by epidemiological week in Brazilian municipalities. Secondary data sources were used, from the National Health Establishment Registry (April 2020) and on COVID-19 cases, February to August 2020. Intensive Care Units (ICU) availability was overlaid on incidence and mortality hot spots in order to assess expanded access in critical regions. RESULTS: Of the 5,570 municipalities analyzed, 54% were identified as incidence hot spots and 31% as mortality hot spots. Of the municipalities in incidence hot spots and with scarce access, 28% were covered by ICU expansion, while with regard to mortality 14% were covered. CONCLUSION: The opening of new beds was not able to provide broad coverage for critical regions and could be optimized with the use of spatial analysis techniques.
136;"OBJECTIVE: To characterize the clinical-epidemiological profile of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children temporally associated with COVID-19 (MIS-C), and to identify factors associated with MIS-C deaths in Brazil, 2020. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study, using national MIS-C monitoring data. Logistical regression was performed to estimate crude and adjusted odds ratios (OR). RESULTS: Median case (n=652) age was 5 years, 57.1% were male, 52.0% were of brown race/skin color and 6.4% died. Likelihood of death was greater among those who presented O2 saturation <95% (ORa=4.35 - 95%CI 1.69;11.20) and altered urea results (ORa=5.18 - 95%CI 1.91;14.04); likelihood of death was lower when red skin blotches were not present (ORa=0.23 - 95%CI 0.09;0.62), when anticoagulants were used (ORa=0.32 - 95%CI 0.12;0.89) and when immunoglobulins were used (ORa=0.38 - 95%CI 0.15;1.01). CONCLUSION: Fatality ratios were higher among cases that presented O2 saturation <95% and altered urea results. Fatality ratios were lower among those with red skin blotches, and those who used immunoglobulins and anticoagulants."
137;"OBJECTIVE: To analyze the trend of notifications of gestational and congenital syphilis in Minas Gerais, Brazil, from 2009 to 2019. METHODS: This was an ecological time series study which took the state of Minas Gerais as its unit of analysis, based on data reported on the Notifiable Health Conditions Information System (SINAN). The Prais-Winsten autoregressive model was used to verify trends. RESULTS: 20,348 cases of gestational syphilis and 11,173 cases of congenital syphilis were reported. Average percentage annual increase was 36.7% (95%CI 32.5;41.0), for gestational syphilis incidence rates, and 32.8% (95%CI 28.0;37.8) for congenital syphilis incidence rates (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: The temporal trend analysis showed that gestational and congenital syphilis incidence rates had significant increasing trends, which may be related to inadequate treatment or failure to treat syphilis during pregnancy."
138;OBJECTIVE: To describe incidents related to healthcare services reported by Brazilian citizens on the Health Surveillance Notification System. METHODS: This was a descriptive study, using the database from the Health Surveillance Notification System (Notivisa) of the Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency (Anvisa), 'citizen' module, between 2014 and 2018. RESULTS: 935 incidents were reported, most of them occurred among females (60.9%), the elderly (20.1%) and those of white race/skin color (51.0%). The majority of the reported incidents were related to the use of medications (50.8%), falls (7.5%) and healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) (7.2%), which occurred during provision of healthcare, treatment or surgery (37.3%), in daytime (58.3%) and in hospital setting (37.4%). CONCLUSION: It could be seen a low adherence to the notification system among the citizens. There was a higher frequency of incidents related to medications, falls and HAIs. This shows that citizens have the capability to recognize and report these incidents as patient safety issues.
139;"OBJECTIVE: To analyze association between food insecurity (FI) and sociodemographic factors among children. METHODS: The study was carried out from May to November 2017 with mothers of children (18 - 35 months old) enrolled at public education facilities in São José dos Pinhais, Paraná, Brazil. FI was determined by the Brazilian Household Food Insecurity Measurement Scale. Multinomial logistic regression was used with a hierarchical model. RESULTS: 395 mothers/children participated. Overall FI prevalence was 34.7% (95%CI 28.5;41.5), with prevalence of 25.7% (95%CI 19.2;32.3) for mild FI (MFI) and 9.0% (95%CI 8.5;9.4) for moderate/severe FI (MSFI). Families in the lowest income tercile had higher likelihood of MFI (OR=3.06 - 95%CI 1.26;7.41) or MSFI (OR=6.35 - 95%CI 1.89;21.4) when compared to the highest tercile. Higher MFI prevalence was identified in male children (OR=2.34 - 95%CI 1.49;3.68). CONCLUSION: FI was associated with lower income and MFI with male children. Public policies to increase income must be included in FI reduction strategies."
140;OBJECTIVE: VTo verify prevalence of intimate partner violence among elderly people and to identify associated factors. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional population-based study using data from the EpiFloripa Idoso Study, with elderly people living in Florianópolis, Santa Catarina, Brazil, between 2013 and 2014. Prevalence rates were described and factors associated using Poisson regression were analyzed, for violence suffered and perpetrated, stratified by sex. RESULTS: Among 651 elderly people, 48.3% of males and 46.4% of females suffered intimate partner violence. Psychological violence suffered (48.3% and 44.8%) and perpetrated (49.8% and 44.5%) predominated in males and females, respectively. Perpetrated violence was associated with poor/very poor self-perceived health (PR=1.74) among males, and with regular self-perceived health (PR=1.53) and separated/divorced marital status (PR=1.86) among females. CONCLUSION: Symmetry was found between the sexes for prevalence of intimate partner violence, for all directionalities of violence analyzed.
141;"OBJECTIVE: To analyze the association between the coverage by oral health teams in the Family Health Strategy (FHS-OH) and the use of dental services among 12-year-old adolescents in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil, 2019. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study involving school-based research, which adopted the use of dental services as its outcome. Structural equation modeling was used to test the association between covariates and the outcome. RESULTS: Of the 615 participants, 74.0% used dental services in the last three years. ESF-SB (oral health coverage by family health strategy, acronym in Portuguese) ≥50% was associated with a greater use of public dental services [standardized coefficient (SC) = 0.10 -95%CI 0.01;0.18], a lower use of these services for prevention (SC = -0.07 -95%CI -0.17;0.01) and higher unhealthy food consumption (SC = 0.19 -95%CI 0.11;0.26). CONCLUSION: Higher ESF-SB coverage was associated with a lower use of dental services for prevention and higher unhealthy food consumption. Teams must organize the access to oral health service and qualify the work process."
142;OBJECTIVE: To describe chickenpox outbreak among Venezuelan immigrants in shelters and occupancies in the municipalities of Pacaraima and Boa Vista, the state capital of Roraima, Brazil, and the control measures implemented. METHODS: This was a descriptive case series study, conducted between November 21 and December 13, 2019, based on secondary database obtained from the outbreak investigation made available by the General Coordination for the National Immunization Program. Descriptive analysis was performed using simple and relative frequency measurements, and measures of central tendency and dispersion were calculated. RESULTS: Of the 9,591 immigrants, 38 active cases and 1,459 susceptible to varicella were identified. With regard to active cases, 23 were female, and those aged under 9 years (17 cases) were the most affected. CONCLUSION: People susceptible to chickenpox were identified during the investigation.

143;OBJECTIVE: To report the university extension research result entitled 'The COVID-PA Bulletin', which presented forecasts on the behavior of the pandemic in the state of Pará, Brazil. METHODS: The artificial intelligence technique also known as 'artificial neural networks' was used to generate 13 bulletins with short-term forecasts based on historical data from the State Department of Public Health information system. RESULTS: After eight months of predictions, the technique generated reliable results, with an average accuracy of 97% (observed for147 days) for confirmed cases, 96% (observed for 161 days) for deaths and 86% (observed for 72 days) for Intensive Care Unit bed occupancy. CONCLUSION: These bulletins have become a useful decision-making tool for public managers, assisting in the reallocation of hospital resources and optimization of COVID-19 control strategies in various regions of the state of Pará.
144;OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the completeness and concordance of infant deaths from congenital syphilis in the Metropolitan Region of Sao Paulo, Brazil, between 2010 and 2017. METHODS: This was a descriptive study based on linkage between the Mortality Information System (SIM) and the Live Birth Information System (SINASC). Deaths with mention of congenital syphilis in multiple causes of death were analyzed. The completeness of 11 SIM variables was analyzed and SINASC was adopted as the reference. The Kappa statistic was used to analyze concordance. RESULTS: There were 134 recorded congenital syphilis deaths, 132 of which were linked. 67 had congenital syphilis as the underlying cause, while 65 involved multiple causes of death, indicating underestimated congenital syphilis mortality. After linkage, the number of variables with excellent completeness increased from two to ten. CONCLUSION: Linking SIM with SINASC data improved completeness. The magnitude of congenital syphilis mortality was found to be underestimated, and the use of multiple causes improved its measurement.
145;"OBJECTIVE: To analyze the annual incidence of hepatitis D cases in both Brazil and the Brazilian Northern region between 2009 and 2018. METHODS: This was an ecological study of hepatitis cases notified on the Notifiable Health Conditions Information System (SINAN), analyzed by sex, age groups, and Northern region states. Temporal trend analysis was performed using the Prais-Winsten method to estimate incident rate annual percent change (APC). RESULTS: In the period studied, 2,710 cases were reported in Brazil, 74.5% of them in the Northern region and 71.5% in Amazonas, Acre and Rondonia alone. APC showed a downward trend in Brazil as a whole (-21.6% - 95%CI -3.8;-36.2%), in the Northern region (-28.5% - 95%CI -5.2;-46.1%,), in Amazonas (-34.1% - 95%CI -0.8;-56.2%) and in Acre (-37.6% - 95%CI -18.0;-52.6%). Cases decreased in age groups below 40 years old. CONCLUSION: There was a downward trend in incidence in the Western Amazon, impacting incidence in Brazil as a whole. This fall was led by younger people, probably due to hepatitis B vaccination."
146;OBJECTIVE: To identify registers of congenital anomalies with national coverage currently available around the world, highlighting their main historical and operational characteristics. METHODS: This was a documentary study by means of a Medline database search (via PubMed) and searches involving reports, official documents and websites. Studies reporting at least one national registry were included. RESULTS: 40 registers of national congenital anomalies were identified in 39 different countries. All registers included in the study were concentrated in upper-middle or high-income countries located in Europe. Most of the registers were population-based, compulsory notification and with a time limit for notification of up to 1 year of age. The Brazilian register showed the highest annual coverage. CONCLUSION: The registers analyzed showed different characteristics, related to the reality of each country. The results presented provide support for the theme of congenital anomalies surveillance, especially in places where such activity is intended to be implemented.
147;OBJECTIVE: To assess regional and social inequalities in mammography and Papanicolaou tests. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study with data from the 2019 Chronic Disease Risk and Protective Factors Surveillance Telephone Survey (Vigitel). The outcome variables were mammography and cytopathology test. The exposure variables were race/skin color, schooling and region of residence in Brazil. Absolute inequality measurements were presented using the slope index of inequality (SII) and equiplots. RESULTS: 23,339 women were included in this study. Having a mammography was 5.2 percentage points higher in women with higher levels of education, while having a cytopathology test was 5.3 percentage points lower in women of Black race/skin color.Having mammography and cytopathology tests was 3.9 and 11.2 percentage points higher, respectively, in the Southern region. CONCLUSION: Social and regional inequalities persist in Brazil and affect mainly women of Black race/skin color, with low education levels and living in the Northeast region of the country.
148;"OBJECTIVE: To estimate prevalence and factors associated with intimate partner psychological violence against women in a rural area in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, in 2017. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional population-based study with women aged 18-49 years old and who had had an intimate partner in their lifetime. Questions from the World Health Organization Violence Against Women Study were administered. Poisson regression was used to estimate prevalence ratios (PR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). RESULTS: 971 women participated. Prevalence of lifetime psychological violence was 17.2% (95%CI 14.9;19.7). Those diagnosed with depression (PR=2.23 - 95%CI 1.70;2.91) and who had consumed alcohol in the last week were more likely to refer lifetime psychological violence (PR=1.53 - 95%CI 1.07;2.17). Single women were more likely to experience psychological violence than married women (PR=1.86 - 95%CI 1.32;2.63). CONCLUSION: Psychological violence against woman in rural areas was related to mental health and alcohol use."
149;OBJECTIVE: To describe the completeness and characteristics of reported gestational syphilis and congenital syphilis cases in the state of Bahia, Brazil, between 2007 and 2017. METHODS: This was an ecological study using data retrieved from the Notifiable Health Conditions Information System (SINAN). Incidence rates at the macro-regional and state levels and percentage completeness were calculated. RESULTS: 15,050 gestational syphilis cases and 7,812 congenital syphilis cases were identified. The incidence rate varied from 1.3 to 15.1 cases in pregnant women/1,000 live births and from 0.5 to 6.7 cases in infants under 1 year old/1,000 live births. Completeness of 'clinical classification' of gestational syphilis varied from 58.2% to 67.2% in the periods studied. CONCLUSION: The study showed an increase in incidence rates, flaws in report form completion and the need to implement routine information quality evaluation.
150;"OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence of dental visits and its associated factors during prenatal care. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study based on interviews conducted with puerperal women in 31 hospitals covered by the Brazilian National Health System (SUS) in Santa Catarina, Brazil, 2019. Sociodemographic, economic and prenatal-related data were collected. Multivariate analyses were performed using logistic regression to calculate odds ratios (OR). RESULTS: 3,580 puerperal women and 41.4% (95% confidence interval [95%CI] 39.7;43%) underwent dental visits during prenatal care. Higher chance of dental visits was associated with higher education level (OR=1.35 - 95%CI 1.06;1.71) and a higher number of medical/nursing consultations (OR= 1.97 - 95%CI 1.47;2.65); this chance decreased when the puerperal women did not have paid work (OR=0.82 - 95%CI 0.70;0.96) and did not take part in education activities offered by the SUS (OR=0.63 - 95%CI 0.52;0.77). CONCLUSION: Factors related to schooling, employment, prenatal care and education activities increased the chance of dental visits during pregnancy in Santa Catarina State."
151;"OBJECTIVE: To identify food consumption patterns and association between overweight and risk of cardiovascular disease. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study with staff of the Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, who took part in the Pró-Saúde Study. Food consumption was investigated using a food frequency questionnaire. Association between dietary patterns (exposure) and overweight and cardiovascular risk (outcomes) was estimated using linear regression. RESULTS: Among the 520 staff assessed, four dietary patterns were found: 'ultra-processed', 'healthy', 'meat' and 'traditional'. After adjustment, the 'meat' pattern was inversely associated with waist circumference (ß=-1.52 - 95%CI -2.66;-0.39), body mass index (ß=-0.56 - 95%CI -1.01;-0.11), and the Framingham Risk Score (ß=-0.36 - 95%CI -0.64;-0.09). CONCLUSION: In view of excess weight, risk of cardiovascular disease and inverse association between the 'meat' food consumption pattern and BMI, it is important to conduct further investigations, with non-working groups, with the aim of gaining greater understanding of the health-disease process related to food consumption."
152;"OBJECTIVE: To analyze ecological association between socioeconomic, occupational and sanitation characteristics and scorpionism in Brazil. METHODS: This was an ecological study with data on scorpion sting accidents reported on the Notifiable Health Conditions Information System (2007-2019).

METHODS: This was an ecological study using monthly data from the Influenza Epidemiological Surveillance Information System, between 2020-2021, in individuals aged 20 years or older. Case fatality ratio and mortality rate were estimated with 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). RESULTS: In Manaus, the capital city of the state of Amazonas, ICU case fatality ratio among those >59 years old was lower in December/2020 (80.9%; 95%CI 78.4;83.3) and during the peak in January/2021 (79.9%; 95%CI 77.4;82.5), compared to the peak in April/2020 (88.2%; 95%CI 86.1;90.3). In São Paulo, the capital city of the state of São Paulo, Curitiba, the capital city of the state of Paraná, and Porto Alegre, the capital city of the state of Rio Grande do Sul, there was a decrease or stability in ICU and in-hospital case fatality ratio in January/2021, compared to the reference month in 2020. CONCLUSION: In January/2021, in-hospital and ICU case fatality ratios decreased or remained stable in the four state capitals, especially in Manaus, and during the epidemic peak with the prevalence of the Gamma variant."
155;OBJECTIVE: To describe the evolution of decrees and indicators related to COVID-19 in Santa Catarina, Brazil, up until August 2020. METHODS: This was an ecological study that analyzed epidemiological indicators and state decrees on social distancing. The decrees were grouped into restriction, maintenance and relaxation. The indicators were mortality, incidence and transmissibility. RESULTS: 179,443 cases and 2,183 deaths were recorded in the period. The incidence rate went from 20.4 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in March to 642.2 in August. Fifteen state decrees were issued. In August, when the highest mortality rate was observed (13.1 per 100,000 inhabitants), it was found that all decree categories, except one, had been relaxed. CONCLUSION: The decrees that relaxed social distancing measures were issued early and in disagreement with the epidemiological context in the state.
156;"OBJECTIVE: To characterize adolescent and adult suicide attempts and self-harm reported in Santa Catarina, Brazil, from 2014 to 2018. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional descriptive study with data from the Notifiable Health Conditions Information System. The sociodemographic, clinical and type of self-inflicted violence characteristics among adolescents and adults were compared. RESULTS: Among the 8,859 notifications analyzed, suicide attempts predominated in relation to self-mutilation; self-inflected violence was more frequent in females, those of white skin color and with mental disorders; it occurred more at home, in both age groups. Among adolescents, repeated self-mutilation (83.3%) stood out, while among adults, repeated suicide attempts (50.6%) and suspected alcohol use (18.3%) at the time of violence stood out. CONCLUSION: We identified high prevalence of attempted suicide among adolescents and adults; the characteristics of violence were similar between the age groups analyzed."
157;"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence of behavioral health risk factors and investigate clusters of simultaneous occurrences of these factors among students at a public university in Pelotas, state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study among university students in the second semester of 2017. Physical inactivity, excessive sedentary behavior, inadequate sleep duration and smoking were the factors studied. Simultaneity of risk factors was evaluated using cluster analysis, through the ratio between observed and expected prevalence, and those that did not include the unit were considered clusters. RESULTS: Among 1,716 students, the prevalence of inadequate sleep duration, physical inactivity, excessive sedentary behavior and smoking were 45.2% (95%CI 42.9;47.6), 44.4% (95%CI 42.7;47.2), 39.8% (95%CI 37.7;42.2) and 10.6% (95%CI 9.6;12.5) respectively. More than 80% of the students presented at least one risk factor. The clusters identified were related to inadequate sleep duration (O/E=1.15) and physical inactivity associated with sedentary behavior (O/E=1.24). CONCLUSION: High prevalence of the four risk factors studied and only two clusters were observed."

RESULTS: Of the total of 958 participants, 62.6% reported a reduction of over 50% in dental visits after the beginning of the pandemic. Adoption of biosafety protocols (PR = 1.04; 95%CI 1.01;1.07), availability of PPE recommended by new protocols (PR = 0.94; 95%CI 0.89;0.99) and adoption of tele-screening (PR = 0.90; 95%CI 0.85;0.96) were associated with the reduction. CONCLUSION: The availability of new types of PPE and implementation of tele-screening in PHCCs seem to have minimized the reduction of dental care after the beginning of the pandemic."
174;"OBJECTIVE: To verify prevalence and factors associated with the use of sleep-inducing medication among women receiving primary health care (PHC) in Vitória, ES, Brazil. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study conducted in 2014 with women aged 20-59. We analyzed association of sleep-inducing medication use with socioeconomic factors and experiences of violence (Poisson regression). RESULTS: Out of 991 participants, 18.5% were using sleep-inducing medication and 45.9% had used it at some point in their lives. Current and lifetime use of these medications was associated with age, years of education, as well as psychological, physical and sexual violence in the last year (p-value<0.05). Lower family income (PR=1.30; 95%CI 1.03;1.64) and controlling partner (PR=1.35; 95%CI 1.08;1.69) were associated with current use, while experience of sexual violence in childhood (PR=1.33; 95%CI 1.13;1.56) was associated with lifetime use. CONCLUSION: Use of sleep-inducing medication was frequent among PHC service users, and was associated with socioeconomic factors and experiences of violence."
175;"OBJECTIVE: To analyze the temporal trend of hospitalizations caused by abortion in Brazil between 2008-2018, according to region and federal units (FU). METHODS: Ecological study concerning hospitalizations due to abortion of women of childbearing age, from Hospital Information System data. The rates were calculated according the characteristics of women. The trend was assessed by Prais-Winsten generalized linear regression.

245;"OBJECTIVE: to analyze the influence of socioeconomic inequality on COVID-19 distribution in larger Brazilian municipalities, controlling for effect of hospital infrastructure, comorbidities and other variables. METHODS: this was an ecological study of COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths in 2020; outcome data were obtained from the Ministry of Health; incidence ratios were estimated using a generalized linear model. RESULTS: we identified 291,073 hospitalizations and 139,953 deaths; we found higher mortality rates in municipalities with a higher proportion of non-White people (95%CI 1.01;1.16) and with more households with more than two people per room (95%CI 1.01;1.13); presence of sewerage systems was protective for both outcomes (hospitalizations: 95%CI 0.87;0.99 - deaths: 95%CI 0.90;0.99), while a higher proportion of the population in subnormal housing clusters was a risk factor (hospitalizations: 95%CI 1.01;1.16 - deaths: 95%CI 1.09;1.21), with this variable interacting with the proportion of people receiving Emergency Aid (hospitalizations: 95%CI 0.88;1.00 - deaths: 95%CI 0.89;0.98). CONCLUSION: socioeconomic conditions affected illness and death due to COVID-19 in Brazil."
246;"OBJECTIVE: to analyze the profile of violence against the elderly and the degree of completeness of event notification forms in Niterói, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. METHODS: this was a descriptive study having as its data source violence notification forms held on the Notifiable Health Conditions Information System for the period 2011-2020; analysis of form completeness was performed according to criteria proposed by the Ministry of Health. RESULTS: of the 486 registered cases, physical violence was the most reported type of violence (48.1%), followed by psychological violence (22.2%) and self-harm (21.4%); the fields with the highest degree of incompleteness were victim's level of schooling (32.8%) and repeat violence (41.5%). CONCLUSION: despite the increase in notifications in the period, predominantly of physical violence, completeness of some of the form fields continues to be poor, which reinforces the importance of training professionals to improve the reporting process and data quality."

METHODS: this was an ecological study, using data from the Mortality Information System; excess deaths in adults were calculated by the difference between the observed number of deaths and expected number of deaths, taking into account the average of deaths that occurred between 2015 and 2019; the variables ""macro-region of residence"", ""quarter"", ""month"", ""sex"" and ""age group"" were analyzed; data were analyzed in a descriptive manner. RESULTS: a total of 6,315 excess deaths in 2020 and 17,391 in 2021, mostly in males (57.4%) and those aged 60 years and older (74.0%); macro-regions and periods with the greatest excess deaths were those in which there were most deaths due to COVID-19; the greatest excess deaths occurred in March 2021 (n = 4,207), with a progressive decrease until the end of the year. CONCLUSION: there were excess deaths in the state of Santa Catarina and in all its macro-regions during the COVID-19 pandemic."
257;OBJECTIVE: to describe characteristics of notifications of sexual violence against children and adolescents according to race/skin color and their distribution in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, between 2014 and 2018. METHODS: this was a descriptive study of data retrieved from the Notifiable Health Conditions Information System (SINAN). Frequency distributions, prevalence and statistical differences were analyzed using Pearson's chi-square test. RESULTS: of the 8,716 notifications, most occurred in the state capital (48.2%) and related to female victims (82.2%) aged between 10 and 14 years (38.1%). There was a higher prevalence (370/100,000) and relative frequency of rape (84.5%), sexual exploitation (5.8%) and neglect/abandonment (4.6%) among victims of Black race/skin color (p-value < 0.05). Only 4.6% of notifications occurred in primary health care services. CONCLUSION: notifications were more frequent among female pre-adolescents and prevalence was higher among Black people, who should be a priority target for protective measures. Surveillance of this form of violence needs to be strengthened in primary care.
258;"OBJECTIVE: to measure the prevalence of prematurity according to the Brazilian macro-regions and maternal characteristics over the past 11 years; to compare the proportions during the COVID-19 pandemic (2020-2021) with those of the historical series (2011-2019). METHODS: this was an ecological study, with data from the Live Birth Information System; the prevalence was calculated according to year, macro-region and maternal characteristics; time series analysis was performed using Prais-Winsten regression model. RESULTS: the prevalence of preterm birth in 2011-2021 was 11.1%, stable; the average in the pandemic period 11.3% (95%CI 11.2;11.4%) was similar to that of the base period 11.0% (95%CI 10.6;11.5%); the North region (11.6%) showed the highest proportion between 2011 and 2021; twin pregnancy (56.3%) and pregnant women who had 4-6 prenatal care visits (16.7%) showed an increasing trend (p-value < 0.001); the highest prevalence was observed for extremes of maternal age, pregnant women of Black race/skin color, indigenous women and those with lower level of education. CONCLUSION: preterm birth rates were highest for socially vulnerable pregnant women, twin pregnancies and in the North; stable prevalence, with no difference between periods."

METHODS: this was a cross-sectional, population-based study carried out in a sample of 88,531 Brazilians, using data from the 2019 National Health Survey; leisure-time physical activity (overall and aerobic exercise) was measured according to the World Health Organization guidelines; the weighted prevalence and respective 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) of physical activity, physical inactivity and sedentary behavior were estimated. RESULTS: according to the selected sample, 26.4% (95%CI 25.9;27.1) of Brazilian adults were physically active, 14.0% (95%CI 13.5;14.4) were insufficiently physically active and 59.5% (95%CI 58.8;60.2) were physically inactive; sedentary behavior ≥ 6 hours was reported by 30.1% (95%CI 29.5;30.8) of the population; only 8.6% (95%CI 8.2;8.9) met the recommendations for muscle-strengthening activities. CONCLUSION: most Brazilian adults were physically inactive and did not meet international recommendations for leisure-time physical activity and reduction in sedentary behavior."
270;MAIN RESULTS: Technology transfer can take place at large events, as long as safety protocols are strictly enforced. It is important to disseminate, at these events, the concepts of the Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI). Implications for services: Face-to-face training course is fundamental for training public health professionals. Technology transfer between research institutions and health services results in updating and improving health system performance. PERSPECTIVES: Based on the success of the reported technology transfer, a new module will be incorporated into the next edition of VEME (Panama 2022), entitled Virus Evolution to Public Health Policy Makers. The objective of this report was to describe the first face-to-face course aimed at training public health professionals in performing real-time genomic surveillance during the pandemic period. Experience report on a theoretical-practical course focusing on genomic research and surveillance, including mobile sequencing technologies, bioinformatics, phylogenetics and epidemiological modeling. There were 162 participants in the event and it was the first major face-to-face training course conducted during the COVID-19 epidemic in Brazil. No cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection was detected among the participants at the end of the event, suggesting the safety and effectiveness of all safety measures adopted. The results of this experience suggest that it is possible to conduct professional training safely during pandemics, as long as all safety protocols are followed.
271;"MAIN RESULTS: Around 3% of the students regularly consumed the five healthy eating markers, with beans being the most frequently consumed; strong association was found between healthy eating markers and behavioral variables. Implications for services: The results obtained can contribute for interventions, programs and actions, particularly in the school environment, aimed at promoting an adequate and healthy diet. PERSPECTIVES: Better targeting of interventions, programs and actions developed in the school environment, seeking to increase consumption of fresh and minimally processed food, along with the adoption of healthy behaviors. OBJECTIVE: to analyze the consumption of healthy eating markers among adolescent students in Pelotas, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, in 2019. METHODS: this was a cross-sectional study carried out in schools taking part in the Health at School Program. Consumption of the five markers (beans, milk, fruit, cooked vegetables and raw salads) within five days prior to the study, obtained through a self-administered questionnaire, was defined as regular. Association between demographic, socioeconomic and behavioral variables and the outcomes was analyzed using Poisson regression. RESULTS: among the 797 respondents, 2.8% (95%CI 1.8;4.1) reported regular consumption. Beans were the most regularly consumed food (48.3%); fruit, cooked vegetables and raw salads were consumed regularly by less than 30% of the students. Doing physical activities, having breakfast and having meals with the family were associated with regular consumption of the foods assessed. CONCLUSION: regular consumption of healthy foods was low in this population, and was associated with behavioral factors."
272;"MAIN RESULTS: An outbreak of illness compatible with scurvy occurred among male prison inmates; most frequent signs/symptoms were edema and pain in lower limbs, difficulty in walking and hematoma/ecchymosis; the associated factor was age > 40 years. IMPLICATIONS FOR SERVICES: The results can contribute to the identification and description of scurvy outbreaks in other contexts and territories. Epidemiological studies of events like this enhance the practice of field epidemiology in health services. PERSPECTIVES: It is expected that the prevention of hypovitaminosis, such as scurvy, will be based on public policies aimed at the population deprived of liberty; and that the capabilities of health services to detect and respond to cases of the disease will be improved. OBJECTIVE: to identify the occurrence of an outbreak compatible with scurvy and exposure factors associated with typical signs/symptoms of hypovitaminosis that occurred in a male penitentiary in Ceará, Brazil between 2019-2020. METHODS: this was a population-based case-control study; we used clinical records and interviews with compatible cases - based on sign/symptom onset during the study period - and with controls; we carried out multivariate analysis. RESULTS: out of 62 cases, mean age was 40.6 years (SD = 10.8); main signs/symptoms were edema and pain in the lower limbs (100.0%), difficulty in walking (91.9%), hematoma/ecchymosis in the lower limbs (90.3%) and fever (88.7%); we identified being over 40 years old as an associated factor (aOR = 1.10; 95%CI 1.05;1.17; p-value = 0.001); and as protective factors: working (aOR = 0.11; 95%CI 0.03;0.36; p-value < 0.001) and taking part in classes (aOR = 0.21; 95%CI 0.08;0.59; p-value = 0.003) in the prison. CONCLUSION: we considered the penitentiary outbreak to be compatible with scurvy due to characteristic signs/symptoms, associated with the identified factors; we recommended regular provision of a diet rich in vitamin C to all male inmates and clinical follow-up of cases."
273;"MAIN RESULTS: A total of 4,029 leprosy cases were notified. Mean prevalence varied between 2.0 and 11.5 cases/10,000 inhab. Spatial distribution of the cases was heterogeneous and there was a falling prevalence trend over the years studied. IMPLICATIONS FOR SERVICES: These findings point to the need to strengthen active tracing strategies and expand health actions and services targeting leprosy, with the aim of increasing detection and early treatment of cases. PERSPECTIVES: It is important to carry out epidemiological investigations on the spatial distribution and prevalence of leprosy in other health regions in the state, in order to identify other areas with greater vulnerability to leprosy. OBJECTIVE: to analyse the spatial distribution and trend of leprosy in municipalities of a health region in a Northeast Brazilian state. METHODS: this was an ecological time-series study based on compulsory notification of leprosy cases by the municipalities covered by the Imperatriz-MA Regional Health Management Unit, between 2008 and 2017; prevalence and mean prevalence for the period were calculated; spatial analysis of the area was carried out and maps were generated using ArcGis 10.5. Prais-Winsten regression was used for trend analysis. RESULT: 4,029 cases of the disease were identified, and average prevalence ranged from 2.0 to 11.5 cases/10,000 inhabitants-year. The overall trend was downward. Governador Edson Lobão had the highest prevalence, 11.5 cases/10,000 inhabitants, and Lajeado Novo had the lowest prevalence, 2.0 cases/10,000 inhabitants. CONCLUSION: spatial distribution of leprosy cases was heterogeneous in the municipalities studied and prevalence had a falling trend."
274;"MAIN RESULTS: From 2000 to 2020, maternal mortality among adolescents and young adults showed a decreasing trend in the state of Bahia. It could be seen an inverse and significant correlation between the highest number of prenatal care visits and maternal mortality in the studied groups. IMPLICATIONS FOR SERVICES: The study suggests the importance of quality obstetric care during prenatal, childbirth, and postpartum period for reducing maternal mortality among adolescents and young adults, especially from preventable causes. PERSPECTIVES: Improving the records of causes of death on information systems, enhancing obstetric care, and investing in sexual and reproductive health policies aimed at adolescents may contribute to the reduction of maternal deaths. OBJECTIVE: to analyze the temporal trend of maternal mortality and correlate it with prenatal care coverage among adolescents and young adults, state of Bahia, Brazil, 2000-2020. METHODS: this was an ecological time-series study and correlation between maternal deaths and prenatal care visits in 10-19 and 20-24 age groups, using the Mortality Information System; the trend analysis was performed by means of Prais-Winsten regression, according to race/skin color, timing and causes of death; and Spearman coefficient was used for correlation. RESULTS: in the study period, 418 deaths among adolescents and 574 among young adults were recorded; maternal mortality ratio was 59.7 and 63.2 deaths/100,000 live births, with a significant decreasing trend (-2.2% and -2.9% respectively); it could be seen an inverse correlation between a higher number of prenatal care visits and maternal mortality in the age groups. CONCLUSION: maternal mortality showed a decreasing trend in the study period, but with high proportions of death; there was a significant correlation between prenatal care coverage and maternal mortality among adolescents and young adults."

Future studies could combine multiple national databases and surveys to increase the accuracy of rates and trends.
297;"OBJECTIVE: To investigate association between depressive symptoms and receipt of retirement pensions or other pensions in the Brazilian population aged 50 years or older. METHOD: This was a cross-sectional study with participants from the baseline (2015-2016) of the Longitudinal Study of the Health of Elderly Brazilians. Depressive symptoms were measured by the eight-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. Prevalence ratios (PR) were obtained by Poisson regression. RESULTS: Among the total 8,469 participants, 33.9% (95%CI 32.8;34.9) reported depressive symptoms and 52.8% (95%CI 51.8;53.9) of the participants received a retirement or other pension. Prevalence of depressive symptoms was lower among participants receiving a retirement or other pension (PR = 0.79; 95%CI 0.73;0.86). Association remained significant after adjustments for sociodemographic and health indicators (PR = 0.84; 95%CI 0.76;0.92). CONCLUSION: Participants who receive retirement or other pensions are less likely to report depressive symptoms. MAIN RESULTS: Prevalence of depressive symptoms was 33.9% in the population studied and, after adjusted analysis, it remained statistically lower among participants who received retirement or other pensions. IMPLICATIONS FOR SERVICES: Prevalence of depressive symptoms was higher in individuals who do not receive retirement or other pensions, which demands attention from health services in caring for this public in vulnerable situations regarding social security. PERSPECTIVES: Carrying out longitudinal studies capable of assessing the temporality of association between receiving retirement or other pensions and the mental health of the elderly, thus contributing to better knowledge about the social determinants of mental health."

METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study, using data from the 2019 National Health Survey; associations between impairments and presence of cardiovascular disease (CVD), hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM), high cholesterol, alcohol abuse and smoking were estimated using logistic regression, thus obtaining the odds ratios (OR). RESULTS: Impairment was reported by 7.6% of the 90,846 participants. Having a impairment was associated with greater odds of reporting chronic conditions, especially CVD (OR = 2.11; 95%CI 1.76;2.54) and DM (OR = 1.78; 95%CI 1.56;2.02 ); visual impairment was associated with greater odds of smoking (OR = 1.52; 95%CI 1.28;1.81); mental/intellectual impairment was inversely related to smoking (OR = 0.45; 95%CI 0.30;0.67) and alcohol abuse (OR = 0.13; 95%CI 0.06;0.26). CONCLUSION: Having any of the impairments studied may be associated with greater odds of having chronic health conditions. MAIN RESULTS: Positive association was identified between having one or more impairments, and health conditions and health risk behaviors. The higher the prevalence of mental/intellectual, physical and multiple impairments, the lower alcohol abuse and smoking. IMPLICATIONS FOR SERVICES: As this population is vulnerable to chronic health conditions, health services need strategies to reduce barriers to access, as well as health promotion actions, such as health education, adapted for people with impairments. PERSPECTIVES: Topics for future studies, examining the inverse relationship between impairments and alcohol abuse and smoking, in addition to acting on the causal chain, so as to prevent health conditions and health risk behaviors."

There was a falling trend in the overall detection rate [annual percentage change (APC) = -6.3; 95%CI -8.1;-4.5)], detection in children under 15 years of age (APC = -8,6; 95%CI -12,7;-4,3) and detection of cases with grade 2 physical disability (APC = -4,4; 95%CI -7,0;-1,8). There was a rising trend in the proportion of multibacillary cases. Spatial distribution of the average detection rate identified hyperendemic areas in the Carnaubais, Entre Rios, Vale dos Rios Piauí e Itaueiras regions. CONCLUSION: High leprosy detection rates were found, despite the falling trend of indicators, except the proportion of multibacillary cases. MAIN RESULTS: Between 2007 and 2021, Piauí showed an improving trend in all indicators analyzed, except the proportion of new multibacillary cases. Spatial distribution identified hyperendemic areas in different regions of the state. IMPLICATIONS FOR SERVICES: This study provides health services with a broad overview of the epidemiological situation of leprosy in Piauí, with evidence of the populations and locations most affected by the disease, whereby public authorities need to reinforce the promotion of health actions. PERSPECTIVES: It is expected that actions to prevent and control the disease will be adopted, such as offering early diagnosis, ensuring correct treatment and implementing measures to prevent physical disabilities."
307;"OBJECTIVE: To investigate excess mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic and its spatial distribution in Pernambuco, Brazil. METHODS: This was an ecological, descriptive and analytical study of deaths, by municipality, recorded on the Mortality Information System, in 2020 and 2021. Excess mortality was measured by comparing observed and expected deaths, the latter estimated by calculating standardized mortality ratio (SMR). SMR and respective confidence intervals (95%CI) were calculated. Spatial analysis was performed by calculating the Global and Local Moran Index. RESULTS: Excess mortality was 20.6% and 27.5%, respectively, in 2020 and 2021, with positive spatial correlation (p-value < 0.05). More populous municipalities (2020: SMR = 1.26; 95%CI 1.24;1.27 and 2021: SMR = 1.34; 95%CI 1.32;1.34), more developed municipalities (2020: SMR = 1.43; 95%CI 1.41;1.44 and 2021: SMR = 1.51;95%CI 1.50;1.53) and municipalities in the Sertão region (2020:SMR = 1.31;95%CI 1.30;1.33 and 2021: SMR = 1.44; 95%CI 1.42;1.46) showed greater excess deaths. CONCLUSION: Excess mortality coincided with peak periods of COVID-19 transmission."
308;"OBJECTIVE: To analyze the temporal trend of completeness and consistency of data on notifications of violence against indigenous women in the health macro-region of Dourados, state of Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil, between 2009 and 2020. METHODS: An ecological time series study was conducted using data from the Notifiable Health Conditions Information System; Prais-Winsten regression was used to analyze the trend of data completeness and consistency, as well as the proportion of completed and coherent fields. RESULTS: A total of 2,630 cases were reported; completeness was found to be very poor in the variable ""occupation"" (48.9%) and poor in the variables ""schooling"" (68.3%) and ""time of occurrence"" (67.9%); in the analysis of temporal trends, only the variable ""occupation"" showed a decreasing trend (p = 0.045). CONCLUSION: The data analyzed demonstrated the need for improvement in the completeness of the variables ""schooling"", ""occupation"" and ""time of occurrence"" of the violent act. MAIN RESULTS: There was a progressive increase in notifications over the years. Most of the variables showed regular or excellent completeness and consistency. In the analysis of temporal trend, only the ""occupation"" variable showed a decreasing trend. IMPLICATIONS FOR SERVICES: Care for victims of violence is part of the daily routine of health services, and it is essential for health professionals to provide adequate compulsory notification for a comprehensive understanding of the victims' profile, thus assisting in addressing this issue. PERSPECTIVES: Further studies are needed to understand the factors associated with violence against indigenous women, which could help the development of health promotion actions and violence prevention strategies targeting these women."

312;OBJECTIVE: To analyze bed demand and occupancy within the Brazilian National Health System (Sistema Único de Saúde - SUS) for the main types of cancer in Brazil, from 2018 to 2021. METHODS: This was a descriptive cross-sectional study, using data from the Hospital Information System. Queuing theory model was used for calculating average admission rate, average hospitalization rate, probability of overload, and average number of people in the queue. RESULTS: The Southeast and South regions showed the highest average hospitalization rates, while the North region showed the lowest rates. The Southeast region presented a high probability of surgical bed overload, especially in the states of São Paulo (99.0%), Minas Gerais (97.0%) and Rio de Janeiro (97.0%). São Paulo state showed an overload above 95.0% in all types of beds analyzed. CONCLUSION: There was a high probability of oncology bed occupancy within the Brazilian National Health System, especially surgical and medical beds, and regional disparities in bed overload. MAIN RESULTS: The study found a high demand for hospital admissions to oncological bed in the Southeast region and a high probability of system overload in the states of the Southeast and Northeast regions of Brazil, thus highlighting the inequities in access to healthcare services in the country. IMPLICATIONS FOR SERVICES: This study presents a methodology for the improved allocation of resources and management of surgical and medical bed flows in areas with the highest bed overload and regions with low service availability. PERSPECTIVES: It is necessary to promote public policies that ensure the equitable supply of beds for oncological treatment within the SUS, especially in states with bed overload and healthcare service gaps.
313;"OBJECTIVES: To analyze factors associated with delayed initiation of breast cancer treatment at an oncology referral center in Juiz de Fora, Minas Gerais state, between 2010 and 2019. METHODS: This was a cohort study using data from the Hospital-based Cancer Registry. The probability of not starting treatment within 60 days, in accordance with Brazilian law, was estimated using Kaplan-Meier, method and its association with the factors studied was assessed using the Cox model, presenting hazard ratios (HR) and respective 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). RESULTS: Among the 911 participants, the probability of delayed treatment initiation was 18.8% (95%CI 16.4;21.5). Those who underwent treatment at a health service other than the one where the cancer was diagnosed had a significantly higher risk (HR: 3.49; 95%CI 3.00;4.07). CONCLUSION: Receiving a diagnosis and treatment at the same institution may help reduce waiting time to initiate cancer treatment. MAIN RESULTS: The probability of study participants not initiating treatment within 60 days was 18.8%. Undergoing treatment at a healthcare service other than the one where the diagnosis was made was the main factor associated with delay. IMPLICATIONS FOR SERVICES: Organizing healthcare services based on strategies that optimize referral flows and avoid transitions of care, can be crucial in reducing the time to initiation of breast cancer treatment. PERSPECTIVES: It is essential to improve the workflows at the different stages of health care to ensure timely initiation of oncological treatment."
314;"OBJECTIVE: To describe vaccination coverage and hesitation for the basic children's schedule in Belo Horizonte and Sete Lagoas, Minas Gerais state, Brazil. METHODS: Population-based epidemiological surveys performed from 2020 to 2022, which estimated vaccine coverage by type of immunobiological product and full schedule (valid and ministered doses), according to socioeconomic strata; and reasons for vaccination hesitancy. RESULTS: Overall coverage with valid doses and vaccination hesitancy for at least one vaccine were, respectively, 50.2% (95%CI 44.1;56.2) and 1.6% (95%CI 0.9;2.7), in Belo Horizonte (n = 1,866), and 64.9% (95%CI 56.9;72.1) and 1.0% (95%CI 0.3;2.8), in Sete Lagoas (n = 451), with differences between socioeconomic strata. Fear of severe reactions was the main reason for vaccination hesitancy. CONCLUSION: Coverage was identified as being below recommended levels for most vaccines. Disinformation should be combated in order to avoid vaccination hesitancy. There is a pressing need to recover coverages, considering public health service access and socioeconomic disparities. MAIN RESULTS: Vaccination coverage of children up to 4 years old was 50.2% in Belo Horizonte, and 64.9% in Sete Lagoas. Fear of severe reactions and believing that vaccination against eradicated diseases is unnecessary were the main reasons for vaccination hesitancy. IMPLICATIONS FOR SERVICES: Recovery of high vaccination coverage among children, considering public health service access conditions and socioeconomic inequities. Acting on reasons for hesitancy that can assist in targeting actions. PERSPECTIVES: The multifactorial context of vaccination hesitancy demands the development of health education strategies to raise awareness about child immunization."
315;"OBJECTIVE: To assess factors associated with hospital self-discharge of patients with tuberculosis in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, 2011-2018. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study in a referral hospital. Clinical and epidemiological characteristics were compared according to hospitalization outcome (self-discharge, formal discharge, or death). Hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) for the association of self-discharge with explanatory variables were estimated using Cox regression. RESULTS: Of the 1429 hospitalizations, 10.4% ended in self-discharge. Female sex (HR = 1.47; 95%CI 1.03;2.11), age ≤ 42 years (HR = 2.01; 95%CI 1.38; 2.93), substance use (HR = 1.62; 95%CI 1.12; 2.34), hospitalization after treatment dropout (HR = 2.04; 95%CI 1.37; 3.04), and homelessness (HR = 2.5; 95%CI 1.69; 3.69) were associated with self-discharge. CONCLUSION: Patients with social vulnerability require more careful monitoring during hospitalization. MAIN RESULTS: Homeless people, illicit drug use, female sex and history of dropout from previous treatment showed association with hospital self-discharge in patients with tuberculosis admitted to a reference hospital in the state of Rio de Janeiro. IMPLICATIONS FOR SERVICES: Need for more comprehensive support for vulnerable patients, in addition to promoting treatment adherence and training health professionals to deal with the complex psychosocial issues related to tuberculosis. PERSPECTIVES: It is crucial to develop public policies that consider social factors in tuberculosis management, as well as promoting cooperation and multisectoral approaches to address both tuberculosis and underlying social issues."
316;"OBJECTIVE: To characterize the use of private services in infant vaccination and assess vaccination coverage according to the service used. METHODS: : This was a national vaccination survey conducted in 2020 that estimated the use of private vaccination services and vaccination coverage among infants residing in state capitals and 12 inland municipalities. RESULTS: : Of the 37,801 participants, 25.1% (95%CI 23.2;27.2) used private services at least once, with higher proportions in capitals, larger cities and in the South and Southeast regions. Socioeconomic and demographic differences were identified among families, based on the service used. The coverage for the set of vaccines administered up to 24 months was 60.3% (95%CI 58.6;62.0) in the public service and 59.5% (95%CI 55.9;63.0) in private services, and up-to-date vaccines, 10.3% (95%CI 9.1;11.6) and 9.4% (95%CI 7.4;11.8), respectively. CONCLUSION: The use of private services was frequent, with low coverage for the set of vaccines, regardless of the type of service used, especially for up-to-date vaccines."
317;"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate vaccination coverage and delay in vaccine dose administration in infants in six municipalities in the Southern region of Brazil. METHODOLOGY: National Vaccination Coverage Survey 2020, with infants born alive in 2017 and 2018, carried out from September 2020 to March 2022. Coverage of doses administered, doses administered on time and delay in dose administration were evaluated. RESULTS: For 4681 infants analyzed, coverage for vaccines recommended up to 24 months was 68.0% (95%CI 63.9;71.8%) for doses administered and 3.9% (95%CI 2.7%;5.7%) for doses administered on time. Delay time for the majority of late vaccinations was ≤ 3 months. For some boosters, 25% of vaccine administration was delayed by ≥ 6 months. CONCLUSION: In addition to tracking vaccine defaulters, strategies are needed to encourage compliance with the vaccination schedule at the recommended ages. MAIN RESULTS: Vaccination coverage for the set of vaccines recommended up to 24 months was 68.0% and 3.9% for on-time doses. Delay time for some doses exceeded six months in up to 25% of infants with delayed vaccination. IMPLICATIONS FOR SERVICES: Monitoring vaccine administration at the recommended ages is necessary, with the adoption of strategies that reinforce routine vaccination to prevent vaccination delays and abandonment. PERSPECTIVES: Primary care in surveillance and care for infants needs to reinforce actions to ensure timely vaccination. Studies to deepen knowledge of vaccination delay, determinants and strategies for their reduction are necessary."
318;"OBJECTIVE: To describe timely vaccination completion and obstacles in the first 24 months of life in Brazil, examining associations with maternal race/skin color. METHODS: Study participants were 37,801 children born in 2017 and 2018 included in the National Immunization Coverage Survey. We calculated prevalence and 95% confidence intervals for timely vaccine completeness and obstacles at 5, 12 and 24 months of life, according to maternal race/skin color. Associations were analyzed using logistic regression. RESULTS: 7.2% (95%CI 6.3;8.2) of mothers faced difficulties in taking their children to be vaccinated, and 23.4% (95%CI 21.7;25.1) were not vaccinated when taken. These proportions were 75% (95%CI 1.25;2.45) and 97% (95%CI 1.57;2.48) higher, respectively, among Black mothers. At least one vaccination was delayed among 49.9% (95%CI 47.8;51.9) and 61.1% (95%CI 59.2;63.0) of children by 5 and 12 months, respectively. These rates were higher among Black/mixed race mothers. CONCLUSION: There are racial inequalities in both the obstacles faced and in vaccination rates in Brazil. MAIN RESULTS: Marked racial inequalities were found in the obstacles to vaccination of children under 24 months in Brazil and to timely vaccination at 5 months and in the first year of life. IMPLICATIONS FOR SERVICES: Racial inequalities in the occurrence of vaccination shortcomings in health services, in the objective restrictions faced by families in taking their children to vaccination centers and in incomplete vaccination in a timely manner need to be addressed by the Brazilian National Health System. PERSPECTIVES: Equal public policies to address barriers to vaccination and qualification of health services need to be implemented. Studies need to deepen understanding of the structural determinants that lead to racial disparities."
319;"OBJECTIVE: To validate the Brazilian National Health System Hospital Information System (SIH/SUS) for maternal morbidity surveillance. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study conducted in 2021/2022, taking as its reference a national study on maternal morbidity (MMG) conducted in 50 public and 28 private hospitals; we compared SIH/SUS and MMG data for hospitalization frequency, reason and type of discharge and calculated sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratios for seven diagnoses and four procedures. RESULTS: Hospitalizations identified on SIH/SUS (32,212) corresponded to 95.1% of hospitalizations assessed by MMG (33,867), with lower recording on SIH/SUS (85.5%) for private hospitals [10,036 (SIH/SUS)]; 11,742 (MMG)]; compared to MMG, SIH/SUS had a lower proportion of hospitalizations due to ""complications during pregnancy"" (9.7% versus 16.5%) as well as under-recording of all diagnoses and procedures assessed, except ""ectopic pregnancy"". CONCLUSION: Better recording of diagnoses and procedures on SIH/SUS is essential for its use in maternal morbidity surveillance."
320;"OBJECTIVE: To identify dietary patterns and analyze factors associated with the consumption profile of socially vulnerable children, Maceió, state of Alagoas, Brazil, August 2019 to December 2021. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study; sociodemographic, anthropometric and food consumption variables were collected, factor analysis was used to identify dietary patterns; associations were analyzed using Poisson regression. RESULTS: Among the 567 children studied, two dietary patterns were identified, healthy and unhealthy; age ≥ 24 months (PR = 2.75; 95%CI 1.83;4.14), male gender (PR = 0.66; 95%CI 0.49;0.87) and maternal schooling ≤ 9 years (PR = 0.61; 95%CI 0.46;0.81) was higher in the healthy pattern; the unhealthy pattern was associated with age ≥ 24 months (PR = 1.02; 95%CI 1.01;1.03) and male gender (PR = 1.46; 95%CI 1.08;1.98). CONCLUSION: The healthy pattern was more frequent in children aged ≥ 24 months, less frequent in male children and mothers with low level of schooling; children aged ≥ 24 months and males showed a higher prevalence of the unhealthy pattern. MAIN RESULTS: Two dietary patterns were defined, healthy and ""unhealthy"", which were associated with male gender, age ≥ 24 months and maternal schooling ≤ 9 years of study. IMPLICATIONS FOR SERVICES: The study data can assist health professionals dedicated to primary healthcare services, such as nutritionists, in planning interventions to promote healthy eating habits aimed at children. PERSPECTIVES: Prospective studies with these populations are necessary to assess the causality of the associations found in this study, aiming to plan more effective public health actions."
321;"OBJECTIVE: To estimate vaccination coverage, identify barriers and hesitancy to vaccinating children up to 24 months, born between 2017-2018, living in the urban area of Rio Branco, Acre, Brazil. METHODS: Population survey carried out from 2020 to 2021, which assessed sociodemographic characteristics and vaccination status among children. RESULTS: Among 451 included children, vaccination coverage was below 80%. Meningococcal C vaccine had the lowest coverage for administered doses (76.3%; 95%CI 70.5;81.3) and doses on time (27.4%; 95%CI 23.1;32.1). The statements ""vaccines cause serious adverse reactions"" (26.4%; 95%CI 18.1;36.8) and ""you don't need vaccination for diseases that no longer exist"" (22%; 95%CI 15.7;29.8) were the most frequent regarding vaccination hesitancy. Lack of vaccines was the main barrier to care (86.6%; 95%CI 71.8;94.3). CONCLUSION: Vaccination coverage in children born in 2017-2018 was below the target recommended for the full schedule of administered doses, both valid and timely administered."
322;"OBJECTIVE: To estimate vaccination coverage and analyze sociodemographic factors associated with non-vaccination in children born in 2017 and 2018 in the state capitals of Northeast Brazil. METHODS: A household survey using cluster sampling was conducted from 2020-2022 to estimate vaccination coverage and hesitancy. Factors associated with non-vaccination were analyzed using logistic regression to calculate Odds Ratios (OR) and their Confidence Intervals (95%CI). RESULTS: Natal was the capital with the lowest vaccination coverage, below 75.0% for most immunizers. Teresina had rates equal to or greater than 90.0% for all vaccines. Among those interviewed, 99.1% (95%CI 98.9;99.3) believe that vaccines are important for health; 95.4% (95%CI 95.0;95.8) trust immunobiologicals and 79.6% (95%CI% 78.8;80.3) are not afraid of reactions. Belonging to the highest socioeconomic stratum (adjusted OR: 1.34 - 95%CI 1.20;1.50) was as a factor associated with non-vaccination. CONCLUSION: Low coverage highlights the need for a better understanding of regional specificities and social inequalities."
323;"OBJECTIVE: To analyze full vaccination coverage in live births in 2017 and 2018 in the capitals of the Midwest region of Brazil, according to social strata. METHODS: Population-based household survey with cluster sampling. Full coverage in children at 12 and 24 months of age and sociodemographic factors were analyzed. RESULTS: 5,715 children were analyzed. Full coverage at 12 months of age was 67.9% (95%CI 65.4;70.4), while at 24 months it was 48.2% (95%CI 45.3;51.1). Pneumococcal vaccine had the highest vaccination coverage (91.3%), while the second dose of rotavirus vaccine had the lowest (74.2%). In Campo Grande, no vaccine reached coverage above 90%, with BCG (82.9%) and hepatitis B (82.1%) standing out. Campo Grande and Brasília had the worst vaccination coverage in the high social stratum (24 months of age). CONCLUSION: Vaccination coverage in the Midwest was below 80%, falling short of the recommended target and associated with socioeconomic factors."
324;"OBJECTIVE: To analyze the reliability of records held on the National Immunization Program Information System (SI-PNI) in a subsample of children included in the national vaccination coverage survey in Brazilian state capitals and Federal District in 2020. METHODS: This was a study of agreement between data recorded on vaccination cards (doses and dates) and on the SI-PNI for 4050 children with full coverage at 24 months. RESULTS: Data on 3587 children were held on the SI-PNI, with losses of 11% (95%CI: 10;12). Total agreement between doses and dates in the two sources was 86% (95%CI: 86;87), however taking each dose and vaccine individually, variation was greater, with 32% of data in only one source. CONCLUSION: Part of the information was not recorded, but the discrepancy can be considered small. Nonetheless, underrecording of doses and children can compromise vaccination coverage estimates, altering the numerator and denominator data. MAIN RESULTS: Subsample of 4,050 children, among those completing the full schedule at 24 months studied in the national survey, 11% had not been recorded on the SI-PNI, 32% had unrecorded doses (doses or dates) and there was 8% disagreement between vaccination cards and SI-PNI records. IMPLICATIONS FOR SERVICES: Recognizing the difficulties faced by the SI-PNI and the discrepancies between sources is essential for adopting initiatives to improve data quality, so as to avoid inaccurate estimates of childhood vaccination coverage. PERSPECTIVES: This study is expected to contribute to improving the quality of records and the usability of data for monitoring vaccination coverage of the immunization program from the local to the national level."
325;"OBJECTIVE: To analyze vaccination coverage according to social strata in children up to 24 months old, living in the municipality of Londrina (PR), Brazil. METHODS: This was a population-based survey conducted between 2021 and 2022, in which vaccination coverage and sociodemographic aspects of mothers and families were evaluated using Pearson's chi-square test. RESULTS: In a sample of 456 children, complete vaccination coverage varied according to social strata, being 36.0% (95%CI 26.8;57.8); in stratum A; 59.5% (95%CI 26.1;86); in stratum B; 66.2% (95%CI 51.7;78.1); in stratum C; and 70.0% (95%CI 56.1;81.0) in stratum D. CONCLUSION: The analysis of vaccination coverage indicated that social stratum A is at highest risk for vaccine-preventable diseases. MAIN RESULTS: The results of the study showed low full vaccination coverage in children up to 24 months of age in Londrina, being higher in the less financially advantaged social stratum, compared to the most advantaged. IMPLICATIONS FOR SERVICES: The results found can support the qualification of the immunization program and enable, based on planning and ongoing health education, the definition of unique strategies to improve vaccination coverage. PERSPECTIVES: Future perspectives point to the importance of carrying out investigations into the challenges inherent to vaccination, as well as qualitative and quantitative research addressing health professionals to better understand the data."

328;"OBJECTIVE: To analyze trends in epidemiological risk of leprosy in Goiás state, Brazil, and its health macro-regions, between 2010 and 2021. METHOD: This is a time series analysis of the composite leprosy epidemiological risk index in Goiás. We used cases held on the Notifiable Health Conditions Information System for calculating indicators separately and risk, classified as high, medium, low and very low. Trends were analyzed using Prais-Winsten linear regression and risk maps were produced. RESULTS: Goiás showed high leprosy endemicity (24.8 cases/100,000 inhabitants) and medium epidemiological risk between 2019 and 2021 (0.58). A stationary trend was found (annual percentage change, 0.50; 95% confidence interval, -3.04; 4.16) for risk of leprosy in Goiás as a whole and in its Central-West and Central-Southeast macro-regions. CONCLUSION: There is need for actions to reduce the epidemiological risk of leprosy, especially where its trend is stationary, this includes early screening for new cases and health education. MAIN RESULTS: Leprosy persists in Goiás state, Brazil, in an endemic form, with heterogeneous distribution. There has been a reduction in the number of municipalities with high epidemiological risk of leprosy, but challenges include active transmission and late diagnosis.

329;"OBJECTIVE: To analyze the temporal trend and the spatial distribution of reported cases of sexual violence against male children and adolescents, and their relationship with municipal development in Brazil. METHODS: This is an ecological study with data from the Notifiable Health Conditions Information System and the Municipal Human Development Indexes (MHDIs), from 2013-2022. Prais-Winsten regression was used for temporal analysis and the Moran Index for spatial analysis. RESULTS: There were 39,967 reports of sexual violence against male children and adolescents. An increasing trend was found for Brazil as a whole (annual percentage change = 6.8; 95%CI 3.8;10.0). Spatial distribution showed direct correlation between high rates of violence and low MHDIs (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: We found a rising temporal trend in Brazil and spatial dependence of the rates of reported sexual violence in the municipalities. MAIN RESULTS: The trend of reported cases of sexual violence against male children and adolescents was rising in Brazil. The spatial analysis showed a direct correlation between high rates of violence and low human development indexes. IMPLICATIONS FOR SERVICES: The identification of underreported areas requires the structuring of health surveillance services. Territories with the highest number of reports require prevention and coping strategies to attend to these victims. PERSPECTIVES: Strategies for prevention, coping and improvement of the surveillance process must be adopted. These include: reception, psychosocial support, comprehensive health care and training of health professionals to notify and report the problem."
330;"OBJECTIVE: To describe the methods for requesting, extracting data, processing and analyzing the consistency of anthropometric and food consumption data of adolescents monitored by Sisvan Web. METHODS: Methodological study with individualized data from Sisvan web between 2008 and 2018. The modules of anthropometry and consumption, made available by the Ministry of Health, had a unique identifier for linkages. Implausible values and individuals outside the age range were excluded. Consistency analyses, with corrections for imputations and descriptive statistics, were performed using Stata 16.0 software. RESULTS: A database was obtained with 18,812,232 observations of anthropometric data between 2008 and 2018 and 440,534 records of food consumption between 2015 and 2018; after merging the banks, 64,976 observations were obtained. CONCLUSION: The combination of anthropometry and food consumption databases made it possible to link individual adolescent data and build a database with information for future analyzes relating to the dietary and nutritional profile of the same individual. MAIN RESULTS: The proposal for processing individual data from the Food and Nutrition Surveillance System (Sisvan Web) generated 18 million observations for anthropometric data and 65,000 observations after merging the anthropometry and food consumption databases. IMPLICATIONS FOR SERVICES: This work will enable replication of the methodology for processing data available in Sisvan Web, allowing for enhanced analyzes by healthcare teams and researchers in the field of public health.

337;"OBJECTIVE: To assess the agreement between complementary feeding indicators established by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Ministry of Health (MOH) and to compare the prevalence of these indicators in the first year of a child's life. METHODS: : This was a cross-sectional study in a cohort of 286 children from Vitória da Conquista, state of Bahia, Brazil; agreement between indicators and comparison between prevalences were analyzed using the Kappa coefficient and McNemar's test; the prevalence of the indicators ""introduction of complementary feeding"" (ICF), ""minimum dietary diversity"" (MDD), ""minimum meal frequency"" (MMF) and ""minimum acceptable diet"" (MAD) were calculated. RESULTS: : Three indicators showed poor agreement, with only one demonstrating moderate agreement; prevalence of WHO indicators was higher than that of the MOH (ICF, 94.3% vs. 20.7%; MDD, 75.2% vs. 50.7%; MMF, 97.2% vs. 44.8%; MAD, 96.8% vs. 26.9%). CONCLUSION: The majority of indicators showed poor agreement and the prevalence of WHO indicators exceeded that of the Ministry of Health."
338;"OBJECTIVE: To describe accidents involving brown spider (genus Loxosceles) bites notified by the Pernambuco Poison Information and Care Center (CIATox-PE), Brazil, from January 2018 to December 2022. METHODS: This was a case series study of brown spider bites notified by the CIATox-PE. RESULTS: The study included 22 cases with median age of 35 years, the majority being female (13); the cases occurred in rural and urban areas (12 versus 10), at night (10); Petrolina was the municipality with the highest number of notifications (6); spider bites occurred mainly in the lower (11) and upper (9) limbs, almost exclusively inside households (21); specific serum therapy was not indicated for 8 cases because the time for its effectiveness had already elapsed. CONCLUSION: Loxoscelism cases occurred more frequently in females, in both rural and urban areas and mainly at home, with delays in seeking medical care. MAIN RESULTS: The 22 cases described represent an alert for the presence of a venomous species not reported in previous studies in Pernambuco. The severity of cases may be associated with delays in seeking medical care, especially due to the population's lack of information. IMPLICATIONS FOR SERVICES: Identify the presence of brown spiders in households in the region and the potential severity of poisonings. Alert health professionals to recognize the clinical picture with a view to appropriate early treatment. PERSPECTIVES: Develop research on poisoning by venomous animals and educational actions alerting the population to prevent these accidents and updating health professionals on care."
339;"OBJECTIVE: To describe the prevalence of perineal laceration, based on the self-reported perception of postpartum women, and to analyze factors associated with its occurrence in Brazil. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study conducted with 23,894 postpartum women, excluding twin pregnancies, cesarean sections, and births with episiotomies, between 2011 and 2012. Prevalence ratios (PR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) of association between the event and maternal, fetus/newborn, obstetric and clinical management characteristics were estimated in hierarchical Poisson regression models. RESULTS: Out of 4,606 postpartum women, 49.5% (95%CI 46.1;42.9) self-reported perineal laceration. Being an adolescent (PR = 1.12; 95%CI 1.02;1.25), primipara (PR = 1.47; 95%CI 1.33;1.63), having had excessive gestational weight gain (PR = 1.17; 95%CI 1.07;1.29) and having undergone the Kristeller maneuver (PR = 1.18; 95%CI 1.08;1.29) increased the proportion of the outcome. CONCLUSION: The results found call for prenatal care and adjustments to childbirth care so as to be in accordance with current recommendations. MAIN RESULTS: Prevalence of self-reported perineal laceration was 49.5%. Being in the adolescent age group, primiparity, excessive gestational weight and the Kristeller maneuver were risk factors associated with the event. IMPLICATIONS FOR SERVICES: Studying self-reported prevalence of perineal laceration supports new care practices, highlights the prevention of risk factors considered modifiable and confirms the need to follow current guidelines. PERSPECTIVES: New national studies are needed comparing prevalence of self-reported perineal laceration with that recorded in medical records in order to support care practices and public obstetric policies."
340;"OBJECTIVE: To assess knowledge on sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) prevention among postpartum women who received prenatal care in public and private services in Rio Grande, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, in 2019. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted with postpartum women who gave birth in that municipality in 2019; the outcome was the indication of incorrect sleeping position (side/supine position) to prevent SIDS; the chi-square test was used to compare proportions between those who underwent prenatal care in public and private services. RESULTS: Among all 2,195 postpartum women, 67.7% (95%CI 65.7;69.6) were unaware of the position that prevents SIDS, 71.6% were public care service users; 77.8% of them feared choking/suffocation; 1.9% were informed about SIDS during prenatal care; doctors/nurses (70.5%) and grandmothers (65.1%) were influential regarding the baby's sleeping position. CONCLUSION: Most postpartum women were unaware of the sleeping position that prevents SIDS, especially those receiving care in the public sector; in general, this subject is not discussed in prenatal care. MAIN RESULTS: Two out of three mothers believed the newborn should sleep in the side or prone position, which does not prevent but rather facilitates sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS); lack of knowledge was significantly greater when prenatal care took place in public services. IMPLICATIONS FOR SERVICES: SIDS should be addressed in prenatal care. Guidance from a doctor/nurse during consultations can be essential for mothers to change their mind and adopt a safe sleeping position (supine position) for their child. PERSPECTIVES: SIDS prevention campaigns are relevant in the context of prenatal care, as is conducting research that aims to evaluate potential impacts of interventions on the correct sleeping position for babies."
341;"OBJECTIVE: To assess the incompleteness of the Robson Classification variables in the Live Birth Information System (Sistema de Informação sobre Nascidos Vivos - SINASC), in the state of Paraná, and its trend, 2014-2020. METHODS: This was a time-series study that analyzed six variables, according to health macro-regions. Incompleteness was classified (percentage of ""ignored"" and ""blank fields"") as follows: excellent (< 1.0%); good (1.0-2.9%); regular (3.0-6.9%); poor (≥ 7.0%). Prais-Winsten regression was used to estimate trends. RESULTS: A total of 1,089,116 births were evaluated. The variable ""cesarean section before the onset of labor"" was classified as poor in 2014 (39.4%) and 2015 (44.3%) in the state and in all macro-regions, but with a decreasing trend in incompleteness. The variables ""gestational age"" in the North and Northwest macro-regions, and ""parity"" and ""number of fetuses"" in the Northwest macro-region showed an increasing trend. CONCLUSION: Most of the variables evaluated showed low percentages of incompleteness with a decreasing trend, but there is a need to improve the completion of some variables."
342;"OBJECTIVE: To analyze HIV Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP) prescription and return for follow-up appointments. METHODS: This was a descriptive cross-sectional study using data on people who sought PEP in emergency care units (UPAs) and specialized medical services in Salvador, BA, Brazil, between January-December/2018. RESULTS: Of the 1,525 people who sought PEP at UPAs, 1,273 (83.5%) met PEP eligibility criteria, while 252 (16.5%) did not; of the eligible group, 1,166 (91.6%) had antiretrovirals prescribed, while 107 (8.4%) eligible people did not; of the total number of people with PEP prescriptions, only 226 (19.4%) returned for the first follow-up appointment, 115 (9.9%) for the second, and 33 (2.8%) for the third in order to complete the protocol. CONCLUSION: We found a significant proportion of eligible users who did not have PEP prescribed at UPAs and a significant loss of return for specialized service follow-up appointments."
343;"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the economic burden associated with COVID-19 in Córdoba, Colombia, 2020 and 2021. METHODS: Economic burden study. Direct costs were analyzed from the third-party payer perspective using healthcare administrative databases and interviews from a cohort of confirmed COVID-19 cases from Córdoba. Costing aggregation was performed by the bottom-up method. Indirect costs were estimated using the productivity loss approach. Contrast tests and statistical models were estimated at 5% significance. RESULTS: We studied 1,800 COVID-19 cases. The average economic cost of COVID-19 per episode was estimated at US$ 2,519 (95%CI 1,980;3,047). The direct medical cost component accounted for 92.9% of the total; out-of-pocket and indirect costs accounted for 2% and 5.1%, respectively. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 economic cost was mainly due to direct medical costs. This study provided evidence of the economic burden faced by households due to COVID-19, with the most vulnerable households bearing much of the burden on their income."
344;OBJECTIVE: To describe the profile of cases of mpox in the city of Rio de Janeiro between June and November 2022. METHODS: This was a descriptive study of secondary data obtained from mpox notification forms. Socioeconomic, clinical and spatial data were analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 928 cases, 93.7% were male, 85.0% cisgender male, 65.6% homosexual, 41.8% between 30 and 39 years old, and 41.0% were of White race/skin color. A total of 34.5% had immunosuppression due to illness, and 41.9% reported their HIV status as being positive. The most prevalent signs and symptoms were: skin lesions (96.6%), especially with multiple manifestations (67.8%) in the genital region (46.1%), in addition to fever (58.3%), adenomegaly (43.3%) and headache (38.7%). Most notifications occurred in public services (81.3%) and in hospital care (51.3%). CONCLUSION: The study revealed high incidence of mpox, especially among young, cisgender and homosexual men. Most cases were mild, with genital lesions, progressing to cure without hospitalization. Person-to-person transmission was predominant.
345;"OBJECTIVE: To assess association between multimorbidity and use of health services in a population diagnosed with COVID-19, in southern Brazil. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study with data from a longitudinal study carried out in the city of Rio Grande, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, in 2021 with all adult individuals diagnosed with COVID-19; descriptive analyses were performed and presented as proportions with 95% confidence intervals (95%CI); Poisson regression was performed and reported as prevalence ratios (PR) in order to assess association between multimorbidity (3 or more diseases) and healthcare service use. RESULTS: In total, 2,919 participants were included, of which 40.4% had multimorbidity (≥ 2 diseases); the adjusted results showed that individuals with multimorbidity were more likely to use most of the services assessed, PR = 3.21 (95%CI 1.40;7.37), for Emergency Rooms. CONCLUSION: Multimorbidity was associated with using different types of health services."
346;"OBJECTIVE: To analyze the association between intimate partner violence during pregnancy (IPVP) and quality of life (QOL). METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted with pregnant women receiving care in Primary Health Care in the municipality of Criciúma, Santa Catarina state, Brazil, in 2022; QOL was assessed in the physical, psychological, social relationship and environmental domains using WHOQOL-Bref instrument; IPVP was evaluated by means of the World Health Organization Violence Against Women; Crude and adjusted linear regression analyses were performed. RESULTS: A total of 389 pregnant women were evaluated; IPVP was observed in 13.6% of cases; in the adjusted analysis, IPVP remained associated with physical, psychological and social relationship domains; pregnant women who experienced IPVP had a reduction in their QOL score by 9.77, 11.07 and 8.95 points, respectively, when compared to those who did not experience IPVP. CONCLUSION: IPVP was associated with poorer QOL in the physical, psychological and social relationships domains. Health services equipped to address and prevent violence against pregnant women are essential. MAIN RESULTS: Intimate partner violence (IPV) was observed in 13.6% of pregnant women and was associated with poorer quality of life in the physical, psychological and social relationship domains. IMPLICATIONS FOR SERVICES: The results emphasize the need for an intersectoral approach in addressing the issue, with specialized healthcare centers for situations of violence integrated with social assistance and public security. PERSPECTIVES: Development of intersectoral policies and actions that strengthen existing ones and ensure social and healthcare assistance to pregnant women victims of violence and their children, given the negative impact of IPVP on quality of life."
347;"OBJECTIVE: To create a protocol for performing minimally invasive autopsies (MIA) in detecting deaths from arboviruses and report preliminary data from its application in Ceará state, Brazil. METHODS: Training was provided to medical pathologists on MIA. RESULTS: A protocol was established for performing MIA, defining criteria for sample collection, storage methods, and diagnoses to be carried out according to the type of biological sample; 43 MIAs were performed in three months. Of these, 21 (48.8%) arrived at the Death Verification Service (SVO) with arboviruses as a diagnostic hypothesis, and seven (16.3%) were confirmed (six chikungunya cases and one dengue case); cases of COVID-19 (n = 9), tuberculosis (n = 5), meningitis (n = 4), cryptococcosis (n = 1), Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (n = 1), breast cancer (n = 1), and human rabies (n = 1) were also confirmed. CONCLUSION: The protocol implemented enabled identification of a larger number of suspected arbovirus-related deaths, as well as confirmation of other diseases of interest for surveillance. MAIN RESULTS: A protocol was developed to perform minimally invasive autopsies (MIAs) in Death Verification Services (SVO), capable of expanding the system's capacity to identify a greater number of deaths suspected to be due to arboviruses. IMPLICATIONS FOR SERVICES: The experience suggests that in-service trained health professionals are able to perform MIA, and that use of this technique in SVOs has been shown to be capable of increasing the system's sensitivity in detecting deaths of interest to public health. PERSPECTIVES: Trained professionals will be able to collect biological material in hospitals, through MIA, in cases of interest for health surveillance and when family members do not allow a complete conventional autopsy to be performed."

METHODS: This was a time-series study using surveillance data; the trend analysis was performed by means of joinpoint regression, and average annual percent change (AAPC) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were estimated. RESULTS: An increase in statewide detection of gestational syphilis (AAPC = 21.7; 95%CI 17.7; 32.8) and congenital syphilis (AAPC = 14.8; 95%CI 13.0; 19.7) was found; an increase was also found in the health macro-regions, with the Northwest (gestational, AAPC = 26.1; 95%CI 23.4; 31.6) and North (congenital, AAPC = 23.8; 95%CI 18.8; 48.9) macro-regions standing out; statewide rising trends were observed for young women [gestational, AAPC = 26.2 (95%CI 22.4; 40.6); congenital, AAPC = 19.4 (95%CI 17.6; 21.8)] and adult women [gestational, AAPC = 21.3 (95%CI 16.9; 31.9); congenital, AAPC = 13.7 (95%CI 11.9; 19.3)]. CONCLUSION: Maternal and child syphilis detection rates increased in the state, regardless of maternal age and health macro-region. MAIN RESULTS: Increasing trends were found for the detection rates of gestational and congenital syphilis in Paraná state and its health macro-regions, including in the analysis stratified by maternal age group; however, there was a decline during the COVID-19 period. IMPLICATIONS FOR SERVICES: There is a need for strategic and immediate action by the state health services, focusing on expanding access and linkage to care, in order to ensure maternal and child well-being and reverse the rising trends observed. PERSPECTIVES: Prevention and control actions towards the elimination of syphilis are needed to overcome these obstacles, directing efforts towards strengthening health education, early detection and appropriate treatment for pregnant women and their partners."
352;OBJECTIVE: To describe the distribution of nutritional status and food insecurity among the adult transgender population in the Baixada Santista region of the state of São Paulo and to identify associated factors. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study using data from the research project entitled Mapping the Transgender Population in Baixada Santista of the state of São Paulo, conducted through a structured questionnaire administered between August and December 2023. The outcomes were nutritional status and food and nutrition insecurity (FNI). The association analysis was performed using Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: A total of 237 people took part in the study. High prevalence of FNI was associated with an income of less than 2 minimum wages (p < 0.001), difficulty finding a job (p < 0.001) and lack of family support related to gender (p = 0.001). Difficulty reading/writing (p = 0.025) and proximity to an open-air market (p = 0.033) were negatively or positively associated with adequate nutritional status, respectively. CONCLUSION: The high prevalence of FNI among the most vulnerable population and the adequate nutritional status associated with proximity to open-air markets indicate the need for policies aimed at reducing inequities and expand access to adequate food.

355;OBJECTIVE: To compare child health booklet (CHB) use and filling out among mothers who were or were not Bolsa Família Program (BFP) beneficiaries. METHODS: Cross-sectional study with mothers of children <6years attending health centers in Salvador, Bahia, Brazil, between January-February/2023. The CHB was evaluated regarding its use (having a CHB, having it in hand, and having read it) and filling out (growth curves, development monitoring forms, and vaccination completeness). Descriptive statistics and the chi-square test were used. RESULTS: Of the 411 study participants, 66% were BFP beneficiaries. Significant differences were found between the groups regarding CHB use: having a CHB (p < 0.001), having it in hand (p = 0.037), and having read it (p < 0.001). Significant difference in vaccination completeness was found (p = 0.005). CONCLUSION: There was a significant difference in CHB use and vaccination completeness when comparing mothers who were BFP beneficiaries and those who were not.

METHODS: this was a cross-sectional study on case fatality due to hantavirus infection from 2007 to 2013 using data from the Notifiable Diseases Information System (SINAN) for Goiás State. Logistic regression analysis was performed to estimate odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). RESULTS: 1,171 suspected cases were reported, of which 73 (6.2%) were confirmed. Among the confirmed cases, greater frequency was found among males (n=50), fever was the most common symptom (n=70), and there was a high proportion of hospitalization (n=68). The case-fatality rate was 57.5% . The following factors were associated with death: acute respiratory failure (ARF) (OR=3.6; 95%CI 1.2;10.6), hemoconcentration (OR=3.3; 95%CI 1.1;7.9) and not using a mechanical ventilator (OR=3.4; 95%CI 1.3;9.1). After adjustment, the ARF was still associated with death (OR=3.4; 95%CI 1.0;11.6). CONCLUSION: the case-fatality rate was high, primarily associated with respiratory failure."
436;"OBJECTIVE: to describe yellow fever occurrence in the state of São Paulo, Brazil, in the period 2000-2010. METHODS: this was a descriptive study using data regarding human cases, epizootics in non-human primates and virus vector isolation in São Paulo State, between 2000 and 2010. RESULTS: three sylvatic yellow fever outbreaks were registered in the state with 32 human cases and 15 deaths; the cases occurred in unvaccinated individuals exposed to the sylvatic form of transmission; epizootics was confirmed before the virus began circulating in humans in the region of São José do Rio Preto and the virus was isolated twice in vectors. CONCLUSION: three sylvatic yellow fever outbreaks occurred in the state between 2000 and 2010, two of them in a transition area and the other in an area considered to be unaffected; vaccination and maintaining immunization coverage are necessary for preventing the disease."

465;"OBJECTIVE: to evaluate productivity targets achievement (PTA) in Dental Specialty Centers (DSCs) from Maranhão State, Brazil. METHODS: this was an ecologic study using secondary data; an indicator for PTA was created for each subgroup of procedures. RESULTS: 25 DSCs were evaluated; the PTA was higher for basic procedures (n=19), followed by endodontics (n=11), oral surgery (n=9) and periodontics (n=8); the best results were obtained at DSCs type II; higher PTA was associated with financial anticipation (basic procedures) and higher Human Development Index, life expectancy and social exclusion rate (endodontics); lower PTA was associated with larger population (endodontics/oral surgery), adherence to the Pact for Health (periodontics/endodontics), larger number of specialties (periodontics) and bigger DSC (oral surgery). CONCLUSION: most DSCs did not achieve productivity targets, except for basic procedures; socioeconomic and health management characteristics of the municipalities were associated with the PTA; the DSCs characteristics explained little about the PTA."
466;"OBJECTIVE: to describe characteristics of oral health care during prenatal check-ups and knowledge about oral health among pregnant women using public and private health services in São Luís, Maranhão, Brazil. METHODS: this is a descriptive study of 300 women interviewed in public health services and a further 300 interviewed in private health services between August 2007 and July 2008. RESULTS: tooth brushing frequency was similar among users of public and private services (p=0.156), while flossing (64.0% and 47.0%; p<0.001) and mouthwashing (39.7% and 27.0%; p=0.001) was more frequent among private service users in relation to public service users; most users of public services (60.3%) and private services (65.7%) were unaware of the association between oral health and pregnancy. CONCLUSION: frequency of tooth brushing was similar among pregnant women in public and private services; the effects of pregnancy on oral health were not well known."
467;"OBJECTIVE: to characterize the physical environment and physical activity (PA) in Primary Health Care Units (PHU) in the urban area of Guarapuava-PR, Brazil, 2011-2012. METHODS: this is a descriptive study in which the coordinators of the municipality's 27 PHUs were interviewed about violence, crime and physical space and safety conditions for PAs inside and outside the PHUs; the streets surrounding the area were visited to evaluate environmental factors categorized as favorable or unfavorable to PA deployment and practice. RESULTS: the most common places for PA were grass areas (n=18) and churches (n=24); three fifths of PHUs presented factors favorable to PA deployment/practice; lack of sidewalks (14 PHUs) or uneven sidewalks (13 PHUs) surrounding the PHUs are conditions that could jeopardize the practice of walking. CONCLUSION: despite the identification of favorable factors for PA practice, at PHUs should be focused by health service managers."
468;OBJECTIVE: to review the challenges and procedures used in Aedes aegypti control and the characteristics of the epidemics in the successful campaign, led by Clementino Fraga, for yellow fever control in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 1928 and 1929, before the vaccine (1937) and DDT (1947). METHODS: a literature review was conducted by searching official reports, scientific journals and historic textbooks on this subject. RESULTS: the A. aegypti control was achieved through the hard and organized work of breeding site police teams, priority in eliminating breeding sites through environmental management measures and a qualified training program for the teams. CONCLUSION: the reports demonstrate a set of simple but laborious procedures that could effectively control mosquitoes in urban environment through the work of the teams, who were committed to environmental management measures, aiming at eliminating breeding sites and were capable of handling social and environmental obstacles.

495;"Hospitalizations due to ambulatory care sensitive conditions (ACSC) are an indirect indicator of primary health care. A package in the R program was developed in order to automatize the classification of codes of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems - 10th Revision (ICD-10), according to the Brazilian list of ACSC, and provide functionalities for the management of the ""reduced files"" of the inpatient hospital authorization (AIH). The csapAIH package contains a homonym function, which reads the data according to its nature (file or data frame with AIH structure, or a factor with ICD-10 codes) and returns, according to defined options, a databank or vector containing the classification for the hospitalization. This article presents the package and the function csapAIH, its installation mode and use, and examples of its functionalities, which may add quickness, precision and validity to the research of ACSC in Brazil."

497;"Measurements of health indicators are rarely available for every population and period of interest, and available data may not be comparable. The Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting (GATHER) define best reporting practices for studies that calculate health estimates for multiple populations (in time or space) using multiple information sources. Health estimates that fall within the scope of GATHER include all quantitative population-level estimates (including global, regional, national, or subnational estimates) of health indicators, including indicators of health status, incidence and prevalence of diseases, injuries, and disability and functioning; and indicators of health determinants, including health behaviours and health exposures. GATHER comprises a checklist of 18 items that are essential for best reporting practice. A more detailed explanation and elaboration document, describing the interpretation and rationale of each reporting item along with examples of good reporting, is available on the GATHER website (http://gather-statement.org)."

539;Measurement instruments play an important role in research, clinical practice and health assessment. Studies on the quality of these instruments provide evidence of how the measurement properties were assessed, helping the researcher choose the best tool to use. Reliability and validity are considered the main measurement properties of such instruments. Reliability is the ability to reproduce a result consistently in time and space. Validity refers to the property of an instrument to measure exactly what it proposes. In this article, the main criteria and statistical tests used in the assessment of reliability (stability, internal consistency and equivalence) and validity (content, criterion and construct) of instruments are presented, discussed and exemplified. The assessment of instruments measurement properties is useful to subsidize the selection of valid and reliable tools, in order to ensure the quality of the results of studies.

542;BACKGROUND: Sex and gender differences are often overlooked in research design, study implementation and scientific reporting, as well as in general science communication. This oversight limits the generalizability of research findings and their applicability to clinical practice, in particular for women but also for men. This article describes the rationale for an international set of guidelines to encourage a more systematic approach to the reporting of sex and gender in research across disciplines. METHODS: A panel of 13 experts representing nine countries developed the guidelines through a series of teleconferences, conference presentations and a 2-day workshop. An internet survey of 716 journal editors, scientists and other members of the international publishing community was conducted as well as a literature search on sex and gender policies in scientific publishing. RESULTS: The Sex and Gender Equity in Research (SAGER) guidelines are a comprehensive procedure for reporting of sex and gender information in study design, data analyses, results and interpretation of findings. CONCLUSIONS: The SAGER guidelines are designed primarily to guide authors in preparing their manuscripts, but they are also useful for editors, as gatekeepers of science, to integrate assessment of sex and gender into all manuscripts as an integral part of the editorial process.

544;"In 2017, Epidemiology and Health Services: journal of the Brazilian National Health System (RESS) celebrates 25 years. RESS was created in 1992 as SUS Epidemiological Report (IESUS) and, in 2003, adopted its current name and format. This study's objectives are to describe the subjects covered and the geographical spread of authors' institutions of the articles published in IESUS and RESS; and to map RESS' editorial policies and strategies in the following areas of focus: education, information, communication, co-responsibility and anticipation. The comparison between IESUS (1992-2002) and RESS (2003-2016) periods revealed an increase in the number of documents published, as well as an increase in the topics covered, the geographical spread of the authors and the scope of publication. The mapping of editorial policies and strategies has evidenced a large number of initiatives aligned with the principles of publication ethics, which may have contributed to the development of the journal."
545;"OBJECTIVE: to introduce the methodology used to calculate post-stratification weights of the 2012 Surveillance System for Risk and Protective Factors for Chronic Diseases by Telephone Survey (Vigitel) and to compare the trends of indicators estimated by cell-by-cell weighting and raking methods. METHODS: in this panel of cross-sectional studies, the prevalences of smokers, overweight, and intake of fruits and vegetables from 2006 to 2012 were estimated using the cell-by-cell weighting and raking methods. RESULTS: there were no differences in time trends of the indicators estimated by both methods, but the prevalence of smokers estimated by the raking method was lower than the estimated by cell-by-cell weighting, whilst the prevalence of fruit and vegetable intake was higher; for overweight, there was no difference between the methods. CONCLUSION: raking method presented higher accuracy of the estimates when compared to cell-by-cell weighting method, proving to be most convenient, although it presents register coverage bias."
546;"OBJECTIVE: to assess the supply and use of procedures for early detection, diagnosis and surgeries of breast cancer in the Brazilian National Health System (SUS). METHODS: descriptive study using data from SUS Ambulatory Care and Hospital Information Systems, and from the National Register of Health Care Facilities; the indicators of supply and use of these services in Brazil and its macroregions for 2010-2012 were calculated. RESULTS: the ratio mammography equipment and female population/100 thousand remained stable (1.5), ranging from 1.0 in the North region to 2.0 in the South; the ratio mammograms and female population/100 thousand increased in all macroregions; there was a low proportion of diagnostic procedures when compared to the estimates (biopsy, 11.5%; core biopsy, 16.6% in women aged 50-69 years); the installed capacity decreased, however the production increased, and the supply (3,995,627) was below the necessary to cover 70% (7,785,415). CONCLUSION: there are inequalities in supply and use of the procedures in the Brazilian regions, and the access to diagnosis is worrisome."

579;This study aims to describe methodological approaches to measure and monitor health inequalities and to illustrate their applicability. The measures most frequently used in the literature were reviewed. Data on coverage and quality of pre-natal care in Brazil, from the Demographic and Maternal and Child Health Survey (PNDS-2006) and the National Health Survey (PNS-2013) were used to illustrate their applicability. Absolute and relative measures of inequalities were presented, highlighting their complementary character. Despite the progress achieved in the national indicators of pre-natal care, important inequalities were still identified between population subgroups, with no change in the magnitude of the differences throughout the studied period. Brazil has important social inequalities, whose consequences still lead to health inequalities. Their description and monitoring are highly relevant to support polices focused on those vulnerable population groups who have been left behind.

The molluscs were captured and taxonomically identified and examined for S. mansoni cercariae. RESULTS: the work was carried out in 427 municipalities (99.5% of the 429 selected); the presence of mollusks was registered in 300 (70.2%) municipalities; Biomphalaria glabrata were found in 62 (21%) municipalities, B. straminea in 181 (60%), B. tenagophila in three (1%); B. glabrata/B. straminea association was found in 53 municipalities (18%) and B. glabrata/B. tenagophila association in one (0.3%) municipality. CONCLUSION: B. glabrata, B. straminea and B. tenagophila distribution records obtained in this study are consistent with previously known distribution."
618;"OBJECTIVE: to describe congenital anomalies (CA) among live births of mothers resident in Tangará da Serra, MT, Brazil, during the period 2006-2016. METHODS: this was a descriptive study, using Brazilian Live Birth Information System (SINASC) data. RESULTS: out of 15,689 births, 77 were registered with CA (prevalence of 4.9/1,000); there was an 80.7% increase of recorded CA in 2016, accounting for 10.3/1,000 live births, including five cases of microcephaly; CA prevalence was higher among children born to women aged over 35 years (prevalence ratio [PR] =1.91; confidence interval [95%CI] 1.01;3.60), preterm (PR=2.22; 95%CI 1.26;3.92) and low birth weight infants (PR=3.21; 95%CI 1.86;5.54). CONCLUSION: low CA prevalence was found, possibly related to under-recording at birth; the increase observed in 2016 may be related to the Zika epidemic causing microcephaly, as well as greater attention by health professionals in relation to CA during this public health emergency."

620;"OBJECTIVE: to describe operational difficulties in the implementation of deltamethrin-impregnated dog collars for the control of visceral leishmaniasis. METHODS: this was a community intervention trial in the municipality of Montes Claros, MG, Brazil, comparing (i) control area - dogs without dog collars - and (ii) intervention area - use of 4% deltamethrin-impregnated collars; an initial serological survey was performed, followed by three further cycles (at 12, 18 and 24 months). RESULTS: out of 4,388 dogs initially seronegative wearing collars, 36.9% were not found in the second cycle, 27.0% of them were lost owing to disappearance/given away/sale, and 22.6% because no one was at home; 56.1% of collars were lost in one year; while among dogs that stayed longer in the study, collar loss was lower. CONCLUSION: high frequencies of collar loss and no one being at home at the time of the visit are operational difficulties for the implementation of a national control program based on the strategy evaluated."
621;"OBJECTIVE: to describe the results of hearing screening performed in children with Congenital Zika Virus Syndrome (CZS) in Fortaleza, Ceará, Brazil. METHODS: this was a descriptive cross-sectional study involving children with CZS receiving health care in Fortaleza, 2016; the hearing screening tests performed were immittance audiometry, transient otoacoustic emissions (TOAE), acoustic reflexes, and cochleopalpebral reflex (CPR). RESULTS: The study included 45 children with an average age of 10 months. 44 of them underwent tympanometric screening, with 16 of these having the right ear within the normal range and 22 having the left ear within the normal range. Among the 43 children evaluated by TOAE, 30 ""passed"" in both ears, nine ""refered"" in both ears and four ""refered"" just in ear; 13/43 ""refered"" and needed to repeat screening. 43 children evaluated by CPR, 37 showed responses. CONCLUSION: most of the children evaluated had completed cochlear function and middle ear results refer in compatible with their age range."
622;"OBJECTIVE: to describe the characteristics of Brazilian sanitation utilities and municipalities according to the water supply system fluoridation situation. METHODS: this was an ecological study using data from the National Survey of Basic Sanitation 2008, the Demographic Census 2010 and the Atlas of Human Development 2010. RESULTS: of the 5,565 Brazilian municipalities, 60% had a fluoridation service; there was variation in fluoridation provision depending on the characteristics of the service providers and the municipality; the greater the coverage of water supply and sewerage and the higher the level of human development, the greater the provision of fluoridation (p<0.001); fluoridation provision was higher in municipalities where the sanitation utilities were mixed-capital companies (75%) and lower when the companies were private (27%) and also when the service was provided only by the municipal government (40%). CONCLUSION: there was an important dependence relationship between the characteristics of the companies and the provision of water fluoridation in Brazilian municipalities."
623;"OBJECTIVE: to describe the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the state of Rio Grande do Sul and the metropolitan region of Porto Alegre (MRPA), Brazil, in the period 1980-2015. METHODS: this was a descriptive study using data from Ministry of Health information systems. RESULTS: 83.313 AIDS cases were recorded in the state; during the periods 1980-1990, 1991-2000 and 2001-2015, the detection rates in the state were 1.1, 17.2 and 40.3/100,000 inhab., respectively, and in the MRPA the detection rates were 2.4, 33.6 and 66.9/100,000 inhabitants, while mortality rates were 0.5, 8.5 and 12.6/100,000 inhab. in the state, and 1.3, 17.3 and 21.7/100,000 inhab. in the MRPA; in 2001-2015, the detection rate of HIV+ pregnant women per 1.000 live births in the state was 8.1 and 13.7 in the MRPA, while injecting drug users in the state (8.2%) and in the MRPA (8.9%) also stood out. CONCLUSION: the epidemic is generalized in the MRPA and with greater magnitude in relation to the state."
624;"OBJECTIVE: to describe sexual practices and health care of women who have sex with women (WSW). METHODS: this was a cross-sectional study with data obtained by means of an electronic questionnaire answered by WSW from the five regions of the country (2013-2014). RESULTS: among 582 WSW, oral sex (95.2%) and digital penetration of the vagina (97.3%) were predominant, with rare use of barrier methods (6.7% and 5.8%, respectively); in the last five years, women who had sex exclusively with women, compared to those who had sex with women and men, were less likely to use barrier methods with women (28.3% versus 41.1%; p=0.041), less likely to have an annual check-up with a gynecologist (38.9% vs. 70.8%; p=0.033), less likely to receive guidance about sexually transmitted infections (STI) (44.0% vs. 59.1%; p=0.034) and about sexual doubts (50.0% vs. 63.0%; p=0.044). CONCLUSION: infrequent use of barrier methods may be a vulnerability factor for STI; it highlights the importance of guidelines for adequate health care for WSW."
625;"OBJECTIVE: to evaluate the performance of Primary Health Care (PHC) in Florianopolis, SC, Brazil. METHODS: this was a cross-sectional population-based study with adults living in the catchment areas of the Health Centers (HC) located in the Northern Health District of Florianópolis in 2012; the Primary Care Assessment Tool (PCATool-Brazil) was applied do assess the presence and extent of PHC characteristics. RESULTS: of the 598 interviewees, 68,4% reported that they considered PHC centers to be their usual source of care; while the usage subdimension of the First Contact Access characteristic was the best evaluated (8.4; 95%CI 8.2;8.6), the service delivery subdimension of the First Contact Access/subdimension accessibility was the worst evaluated (3.5; 95%CI 3.3; 3.6); four (36.6%) of the eleven PHC centers evaluated had a high overall and essential PHC score, although their overall mean score was low (6.4; 95%CI 6.2;6.5). CONCLUSION: considering the PHC model evaluated by PCATool-Brazil, PHC services need to be improved, especially with regard to their process and structure components."
626;"OBJECTIVE: to evaluate the degree of implementation of the National Dengue Control Program (PNCD) in two border municipalities in Mato Grosso do Sul State (Corumbá and Ponta Porã), Brazil, 2016. METHODS: This was a normative evaluation based on indicators of service structure and work process; questionnaires were answered by health professionals involved in dengue prevention and control; the cut-off points used to determine the degree of implementation were 'implemented' (>75% of the activities implemented), 'partially implemented' (50 to 75%), 'low level of implementation' (25 to 49%), and 'not implemented' (<25%). RESULTS: 383 health professionals participated in this study, 227 of whom were from Corumbá and 156 from Ponta Porã; the degree of PNCD implementation was 63.1% and 66.4% for Corumbá and Ponta Porã, respectively, thus being classified as partially implemented in both municipalities. CONCLUSION: PNCD implementation was partial in both municipalities; problems observed indicate the need for program enhancement."
627;"OBJECTIVE: to analyze the incidence of syphilis in pregnant women (SPW) and congenital syphilis (CS) and the correlation of these indicators with Family Health Strategy (FHS) coverage in Goiás, Brazil, from 2007 to 2014. METHODS: this was an ecological study using Notifiable Diseases Information System (SINAN) data and data from the Health Ministry's Department of Primary Care; Spearman's correlation was used to evaluate the relationship between FHS coverage and syphilis incidence. RESULTS: SPW incidence increased from 2.8 to 9.5/1,000 live births, while CS incidence increased from 0.3 to 2.5/1,000 live births (p<0.05) in the period 2007-2014; there was a significant increase in CS cases in municipalities with percentage FHS coverage below 75% (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: the concomitant increase in SPW and CS incidence suggests failures in the prevention of vertical transmission of syphilis, especially in regions with lower FHS coverage."
628;"OBJECTIVE: to analyze the prevalence of inadequate human anti-rabies post-exposure prophylaxis in patients attacked by animals in the state of Ceará, Brazil, 2007-2015. METHODS: this was a study of the prevalence of inadequate prophylaxis procedures, using data on reported cases of accidents involving animals potentially capable of transmitting rabies registered on the Notifiable Diseases Information System (SINAN) from January 2007 to December 2015. RESULTS: of the 231,694 reported cases, 95.8% were found to have inadequate procedures, especially in young people aged under 19 (37.6%), with no difference between the sexes (p=0.04); higher prevalence rate of inadequate procedures occurred with regard to exposure to bites (PR=1.03 - 95%CI 1.02;1.03), multiple injuries (PR=1.07 - 95%CI 1.06;1.07), accidents involving dead/missing animals (RP=1.05 - 95%CI 1.05;1.06), and vaccine treatments (RP=1.03 - 95%CI 1.02;1.03). CONCLUSION: high prevalence of inadequate procedures indicates the need for a better epidemiological evaluation of cases and compliance with the Human Rabies Prophylaxis Technical Standards, in order to ensure adequate anti-rabies prophylaxis procedures."
629;"OBJECTIVE: to describe schistosomiasis cases and deaths among residents of the city of Recife, Pernambuco, Brazil, from 2005 to 2013. METHODS: this was a descriptive epidemiological study using data from the Mortality Information System (SIM) (2005-2013) and the Notifiable Diseases Information System (SINAN) (2007-2013); active tracing of the relatives of the dead was undertaken and probabilistic linkage of the databases (2007-2013) was performed using the Reclink program. RESULTS: 297 schistosomiasis deaths were recorded on the SIM system; through active tracing, 130 relatives were contacted and 20.8% autochthony was identified; 388 cases resident in Recife were registered on the SINAN system; through probabilistic linkage, 23 matching records were identified on SIM and SINAN. CONCLUSION: investigation of deaths showed that some individuals had never traveled outside Recife and progressed to the chronic stage of the disease; 23.8% of the cases registered on SINAN had Recife as the municipality in which infection occurred."
630;"OBJECTIVE: to describe improvement of the quality of data on the underlying cause of death from external causes, after performing Health, Public Security and Press sector database linkage in the State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, 2014. METHODS: deterministic data linkage on deaths from external causes of undetermined intent and deaths from undetermined natural causes held on the Mortality Information System (SIM), Forensic Institute, Civil Police, Urgent Mobile Care Service (SAMU) and press databases. RESULTS: of the 13,916 deaths from external causes, deaths from causes of undetermined intent were reduced from 5,836 (41.9%) to 958 (6.9%); while 222 (10.7%) of the 2,069 deaths from undetermined natural causes were reclassified to external causes; there was an increase in mortality due to traffic accidents (93.0%), assault (71.6%), legal intervention (744.7%), intentional self-harm (112%) and other accidents (29.9%). CONCLUSION: there was an improvement in the quality of the information by type of underlying cause of death from external causes, using a strategy that can be reproduced by other services."
631;"OBJECTIVE: to analyze the impact of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV10) on pneumonia hospital admissions among children in Santa Catarina, Brazil, 2006-2014. METHODS: this was an ecological study using data obtained from Brazilian National Health System Information Technology Department (Datasus) for 2006-2009 (pre-vaccination period) and 2010-2014 (post-vaccination period); time trends were evaluated using the Poisson regression coefficient. RESULTS: in the comparison between pre- and post-vaccination periods, the percentage difference in the hospitalization rate for children under 1 year old ranged from -44.1% in the Western region to -1.4% in the Serrano Plateau region, and in children between 1-4 years old it ranged from -37.1% in the Northern Plateau region to 16.9% in the Serrano Plateau region (p<0.05); hospitalization rates in the state reduced by 23.3% in children under 1 year old and by 8.4% in those aged 1-4 years. CONCLUSION: a significant reduction in the rate of pneumonia hospitalization in children under 1 year old age was found, suggesting the effectiveness of the vaccine in reducing hospitalizations."
632;"OBJECTIVE: to compare the temporal evolution and spatial distribution of epidemiological indicators of leprosy, both crude and also corrected using the empirical Bayesian model, Bahia, Brazil, 2001-2012. METHODS: this was an ecological study using data from the Notifiable Diseases Information System; all 417 municipalities in Bahia were included and the following indicators per 100,000 inhabitants were analyzed - detection rate of new cases in the general population, in those <15 years old, and in those with grade 2 physical disability -; the local empirical Bayesian model was used to smoothen the indicators, and Student's t-test was used to compare means. RESULTS: indicators estimated by the model were higher than crude indicators; estimated detection rates in the general population and in those <15 years old were higher than crude rates in 253 (60.7%) and 209 (50.1%) municipalities, respectively; areas of greatest risk were concentrated in the northwestern and southern regions of the state. CONCLUSION: spatial distribution of the disease was heterogeneous and there was possible underreporting of cases."
633;"OBJECTIVE: to analyze evolution as to conducting seven or more prenatal consultations with pregnant women in Brazil, in the period 2000-2015 according to maternal education level and race/skin color of the newborn baby. METHODS: this was a time series study based on Live Births Information System (SINASC) data; relative and absolute inequalities were investigated, adjusted for maternal age and gestational week in which childbirth occurred. RESULTS: we analyzed approximately 48 million births; the proportion of seven or more prenatal consultations increased nationally (from 46.0% to 66.9%) in all groups analyzed; the relative difference between the extremes of education level ranged from 3.0 to 2.0, while the absolute difference ranged from 53.1 to 47.7 percentage points; the adjusted ratio between White/Black race/skin color was 1.4 in 2000 and 1.2 in 2015. CONCLUSION: the proportion of pregnant women having seven or more prenatal consultations has increased in Brazil, although inequalities are still found."
634;"OBJECTIVE: to estimate mortality trends for Road Traffic Accidents (RTA) in Goiânia (2006-2014). METHODS: this was an ecological study with Mortality Information System data and population data from DATASUS and Goiânia City Government. We analyzed the time series for mortality from standardized RTA. RESULTS: 3,347 deaths were included. We found significant mortality trends: pedestrians (average percentage annual increment rate - %AIR: -4.7; 95%CI -8.2;-1.1) and automobiles (%AIR: 2.6; 95%CI0.2;5.1) in Goiânia as a whole, pedestrians (%AIR: -11.3; 95%CI-20.7;-0.8), motorcycles (%AIR -13.5; 95%CI -19.0;-7.7) and automobiles (%AIR: 12.9; 95%CI2.6;24.2) in the city's Southern District, pedestrians (%AIR: -7.8; 95%CI-14.0;-1.2) in the Western District and automobiles (%AIR: -7.4; 95% 95%CI -13.8;-0.5) in the Campinas-Center District. The other time series remained stationary. CONCLUSION: The RTA mortality rate in Goiânia as a whole reduced for pedestrians and increased for automobiles. In the city's health districts, the rate reduced for pedestrians/motorcycles and increased for automobiles in the Southern District. The rate reduced for pedestrians and automobiles in the Western and Campinas-Center Districts respectively."
635;"OBJECTIVE: to describe a solution enabling geolocation of hospital admissions (AIH), processed on the Brazilian National Health System's Hospital Information System. METHODS: in order to spatialize AIHs an R language script was written, based on the microdatasus and CepR packages; the script was applied to identify all AIHs in Goiás state in the year 2015; after downloading and pre-processing the data, the procedure for AIH spatialization was detailed. RESULTS: of the 361,213 AIHs processed, we were able to retrieve 24,220 different ZIP codes (CEPs); from this set of ZIP codes, 23,910 (98.7%) were geolocated; these geolocated ZIP codes enabled spatialization of 97.7% of AIHs processed for the state of Goiás. CONCLUSION: it is possible to spatialize AIHs with a high success rate; the method detailed in this paper opens a new range of possibilities for the design of evaluation studies, formulation of policies and planning of health care actions."
636;"OBJECTIVE: to analyze factors associated with the need for dental treatment in adults due to dental caries and tooth loss. METHODS: this was a cross-sectional study with a random sample of adults attending Fluminense Federal University School of Dentistry outpatient clinics, in Niterói, RJ, between July and December 2013; we used data collected from clinical records; a questionnaire was administered in interviews; logistic regression analysis was performed to obtain crude and adjusted odds ratios (OR). RESULTS: 212 individuals participated, 71.7% were women; the prevalence of need for dental treatment was 56.1% (95%CI 49.4;62.7); need for treatment was lower in individuals with higher family income (OR=0.53 - 95%CI 0.28;0.98), and higher in women (OR=2.28 - 95%CI 1.21;4.32).

639;Paracoccidioidomycosis is a systemic fungal disease associated with agricultural activities. Its incidence and prevalence are underestimated because of the lack of reporting in several Brazilian states. If paracoccidiodomycosis is not diagnosed and treated early and adequately, endemic fungal infection may result in serious sequelae. In addition to the Paracoccidioides brasiliensis (P. brasiliensis) complex, the appearance of a new species, Paracoccidioides lutzii (P. lutzii), in Rondônia state, where the disease has reached epidemic levels, and in the country's Midwest region and Pará state, are challenges to diagnosis and to the urgent availability of antigens that are reactive with patients' sera. These guidelines aim to update the first Brazilian consensus on paracoccidioidomycosis by providing evidence-based recommendations for bedside patient management. The guidelines provide data on etiology, epidemiology, immunopathogenesis, diagnosis, treatment and sequelae, with emphasis on diagnosis and treatment, as well as current recommendations and challenges in this field of knowledge.

641;"OBJECTIVE: to describe the frequency and reasons for hospitalizations for ambulatory care-sensitive conditions (HACSC) in Rondônia, Brazil, between 2012 and 2016, and to analyze their relationship with the evolution of the coverage of the family health strategy (FHS) in the same period. METHODS: this was a descriptive study of secondary data from the Brazilian National Health System's Hospital Information System. RESULTS: during the period of the study 133,958 HACSC were authorized, corresponding to a rate of 75 hospitalizations/1,000 inhab.; there was a parallel annual increase in FHS coverage and a slightly decreasing trend of authorized HACSC, although this was not statistically significant; in 2012, HACSC frequency was 20.7% in relation to all hospitalizations that occurred in the state, while in 2016 this indicator declined to 16.7%. CONCLUSION: HACSC frequency in Rondônia was high between 2012 and 2016; although there was an increase in FHS coverage in the same period, this increase was not accompanied by a significant change in the frequency of HACSC registered in the state."
642;"OBJECTIVE: to evaluate the implantation of the Notifiable Diseases Information System (SINAN) in Pernambuco, Brasil, 2014. METHODS: This was an evaluation study based on primary data (interviews) and secondary data (SINAN documents/data) provided by the State Health Department and its Regional Divisions in order to estimate the degree of SINAN implantation, comparing structure and process indicators with results achieved. RESULTS: SINAN was found to be partially implemented at central level (77.2%); and at regional level (61.2%), ranging from 54.7 to 71.6%; the following components had been implemented: reporting/investigation (90.0%) and processing (84.1%); analysis/divulgation had been partially implemented (61.6%); while monitoring (53.4%) and management (56.8%) were incipient; there was a lack of planning and published information bulletins; 46.9% of municipalities closed compulsory reporting on time; 68.7% sent batches regularly, 3.0% of tuberculosis cases were duplicated. CONCLUSION: SINAN was found to be partially implemented in Pernambuco due to shortcomings in monitoring and management, with negative influences on system results; its strengths related to reporting, investigation and data processing."
643;"OBJECTIVE: to describe spatial patterns of intentional homicides in João Pessoa, Paraíba, Brazil, 2011-2016. METHODS: this was an ecological study using census tracts as units of analysis; the study used data on intentional homicides of victims living in João Pessoa obtained by cross-checking Mortality Information System SIM information with Public Security information; mortality coefficients were calculated for the whole period and its triennia and were later smoothed using the local empirical Bayesian method; spatial autocorrelation techniques were applied to the smoothed coefficients which were using Moran's spatial statistics. RESULTS: significant spatial autocorrelation was detected for the period as a whole I=0.679, p=0.01, the 1st triennium I=0.508, p=0.01, and the 2nd triennium I=0.572, p=0.01; areas of greater risk were identified distributed among the western, northwestern, southeastern, and far south zones of the city, mainly in regions with low socioeconomic conditions; census tracts with low coefficients were located in areas of medium/high socioeconomic status. CONCLUSION: homicides in João Pessoa were high in poor districts and these are priority areas for intervention."
644;"OBJECTIVE: to evaluate, under simulated field conditions, the efficacy of pyriproxyfen (juvenile hormone), novaluron (chitin inhibitor) and spinosad (biolarvicide) in controlling Aedes aegypti. METHODS: periodic exposition of Ae. aegypti larvae collected in Itabuna, BA, Brazil, to recipients treated with larvicides and comparison of residual effect of treatment with the Rockefeller strain. RESULTS: the inhibitory effect on adult emergence after 60 days was spinosad 89.5%, novaluron 96.5% and pyriproxifen 75.4% for Itabuna larvae, with no statistical difference (p=0.412) between treatments; spinosad and novaluron had a higher percentage of mortality in the larval stage, 98.8% and 97.9% respectively; pyriproxyfen showed higher mortality (95.1%) in the pupal stage. CONCLUSION: the three larvicides demonstrated similar control; however, pyriprofyxen might give a false impression of breeding ground positivity as it acts at the pupal stage, compromising the indicators of infestation that are strategic parameters for control actions."
645;"OBJECTIVE: to calculate mortality rates on the first day of life from 2010 to 2015 in eight Brazilian Federative Units providing better quality information, to assess associated factors and to classify deaths by underlying causes and avoidability. METHODS: this was a descriptive study; mortality rates were compared according to maternal and child characteristics; avoidability analysis used the 'Brazilian list of avoidable causes of death'. RESULTS: 21.6% (n=20,791) of all infant deaths occurred on the first day of life; the mortality rate reduced from 2.7 to 2.3 deaths/1,000 live births; rates were higher in live births with low birthweight and preterm births, and among babies born to mothers with no schooling; main causes of death were respiratory distress syndrome (8.9%) and extreme immaturity (5.2%); 66.3% of causes of death were avoidable. CONCLUSION: 2/3 of deaths on the first day of life could have been avoided with adequate care for women during pregnancy and delivery and adequate care for live births."
646;"OBJECTIVE: to analyze the completeness and reliability of data on perinatal deaths held on Brazil's Mortality Information System (SIM) in 2011-2012. METHODS: this was a study evaluating the quality of completeness of data on perinatal deaths reported on SIM compared to data from the 'Birth in Brazil' survey for the same period; to evaluate reliability, we used the Kappa coefficient, the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and the Bland-Altman plot method. RESULTS: completeness was greater than 80%, and agreement was 0.61 for 10 of the 12 evaluated fields; aggregated gestation length (Kappa coefficient=0.542) and continuous gestation length (ICC=0.448) for early neonatal deaths and fetal deaths, respectively, had regular agreement; graphical evaluation of gestation length showed that the fetal death metric was underestimated and that early neonatal deaths were overestimated by between 25 and 35 weeks of gestation. CONCLUSION: the information analyzed available on SIM for perinatal deaths is complete and reliable for the period analyzed."
647;"OBJECTIVE: to analyze frailty prevalence and associated factors in the elderly in the city of Pelotas, RS, Brazil, in 2014. METHODS: this was a cross-sectional, population-based study of a sample of individuals aged 60 years old or older; a modified version of the Edmonton Frail Scale was used to assess frailty; prevalence ratios (PR) and their 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were estimated using Poisson regression. RESULTS: frailty prevalence was 13.8% and was higher among individuals aged 75 years or older (PR 4.33 - 95%CI 2.94;6.39), those of the female gender (PR 1.46 - 95%CI 1.06;2.03) and those living without a partner (PR 1.54 - 95%CI 1.16;2.04); epilepsy (PR 3.58 - 95%CI 2.19;5.85), ischemia (PR 2.56 - 95%CI 2.00;3.28), and heart failure (PR 2.48 - 95%CI 1.92;3.19) were the morbidities most highly associated with frailty. CONCLUSION: frailty was associated with older individuals, the female gender, those living without a partner and those affected by multiple morbidities."
648;"OBJECTIVE: to analyze association between environmental variables and leptospirosis incidence in the municipality of Rio Branco, Acre, Brazil, 2008-2013. METHODS: this was an ecological study of association between monthly average environmental variables and monthly leptospirosis incidence, according to generalized autoregressive score models and moving averages. RESULTS: increases in the monthly average levels of the River Acre and days of precipitation per month were associated with a 7% increase (incidence rate ratio [RR] 1.07 - 95%CI 1.02;1.14) and a 4% increase (RR 1.04 - 95%CI 1,00;1,07) in the monthly incidence of leptospirosis, respectively; in 2013 leptospirosis incidence in the municipality was 8 times higher than in 2008 (RR 8.00 - 95%CI 4.07;15.71). CONCLUSION: this study showed a strong increase in leptospirosis incidence, over the years studied, and positive associations with environmental variables."
649;"OBJECTIVES: to estimate prevalence and factors associated with having mammography examinations among adult women aged 40 to 59 years old in primary health care services. METHODS: a cross-sectional study was performed in 26 health centers in Vitória, Espírito Santo, Brazil; data were collected from March to September 2014; the independent variables described sociodemographic, behavioral and reproductive characteristics, having mammography performed every two years as the outcome. RESULTS: 400 users participated, 57.8% of whom undergo mammography every two years; having the examination was more prevalent among women aged 50-59 years (PR=1.48 - 95%CI 1.25;1.75), those belonging to economic class A/B (PR=1.81 - 95%CI 1.22;2.68) and those who no longer menstruate (PR=1.31 - 95%CI 1.08;1.60). CONCLUSION: although the proportion of mammography examinations performed is in keeping with recommended levels, a higher frequency was found among the 50-59 age group belonging to class A/B, suggesting unequal access to this examination."
650;"OBJECTIVE: to estimate the prevalence of Pap tests not performed in the last three years and never performed in women and to analyze factors. METHODS: this was a cross-sectional study with women aged 20 to 69 years living in São Leopoldo, RS, Brazil, in 2015; prevalence ratios (PR) were calculated using Poisson regression. RESULTS: among 919 women, prevalence of delayed testing was 17.8% (95% confidence interval [95%CI]15.4;20.3) and never tested prevalence was 8.1% (95%CI6.3%;9.8%); in the adjusted analysis, the increase in the prevalence of delayed testing was associated with economic class D/E (PR=2.1 - 95%CI1.3;3.5), being aged 20-29 years (PR=3.2 - 95%CI2.1;4.9) and not having had a medical appointment (PR=3.0 - 95%CI2.1;4.1); never having tested was associated with economic class D/E (PR=2.6 - 95%CI1.4;5.0), being aged 20-29 years (PR=24.1 - 95%CI6.4;90.9), and not having had a medical appointment (PR=2.9 - 95%CI1.7;4.8). CONCLUSION: coverage of the test was high but characterized by social inequality."
651;"OBJECTIVE: to analyze the survival of people with AIDS and association with schooling and race/skin color. METHODS: this was a retrospective cohort study of people diagnosed with AIDS between 1998 and 1999, in the South and Southeast regions of Brazil. We used survival analysis (Kaplan-Meier method), stratified by schooling and race/skin color and multivariate analysis was performed using Cox regression. RESULTS: the study included 2,091 people who had survived at 60 months, with 65% survival among White participants and 62% among Black/brown participants. Irregular use of antiretroviral (HR=11.2 - 95%CI8.8;14.2), and age ≥60 years (HR=2.5 - 95%CI1.4;4.4) were related to lower survival; schooling >8 years (HR=0.4 - 95%CI0.3;0.6) and being female (HR=0.6 - 95%CI0.5;0.8) were positively related to survival; those with less schooling had lower survival. CONCLUSION: lower schooling levels overlap race/skin color differences in relation to survival; these inequalities explain the differences found, despite the policies on universal access to antiretroviral."
652;"OBJECTIVE: to evaluate the implantation of the Mortality Information System (SIM) in Pernambuco, Brazil. METHODS: this was an evaluation study; primary data (questionnaires) and secondary data (SIM) were used for the municipalities to estimate the degree of implantation (DI), comparing structure and process indicators with outcome indicators; data were consolidated by region and state. RESULTS: SIM was partially implanted in the state (70.6%) and its regions (66.3% to 74.8%); 'management' (75.1%), 'issuing and filling in' (79.1%), and 'processing' (71.7%) were partially implanted; 'collection' (80.7%) was implanted; while 'distribution and control' (49.7%) and 'analysis and dissemination' (58.0%) had incipient implantation; more than 90% coverage was found for deaths with defined underlying causes, as well as for municipalities with monthly data transfer, and death certificates typed and sent on a timely basis; consistency was found between DI and outcome indicators, which improved as DI increased. CONCLUSION: SIM was found to be only partially implanted owing to inadequacies in distribution, control, analysis and dissemination, thus influencing unfavorably the effects observed."

RESULTS: 188 cases were studied, mostly males (66.5%), rural residents (67.0%), children under 15 years (49.6%), with biting being the most frequent form of exposure (81.9%); frequency was highest in the period 2000-2008 (85.6%), with 46.6% of cases involving dogs and 45.9% bats; median incubation was 50 days, followed by, predominantly, symptoms of fever (92.6%), agitation (85.2%), paresthesia (66.7%), and dysphagia/paralysis (51.9%); the majority (70.2%) did not have prophylaxis and for the rest (29.8%) who did have prophylaxis, it was untimely and/or incomplete; 13 patients were treated according to the Recife Protocol, and two survived. CONCLUSION: human rabies incidence reduced and its epidemiological profile changed, with predominance of cases transmitted by bats; we suggest that secondary cases be investigated, and that pre-exposure prophylaxis be made available to populations at greater risk of accidents involving bats."
666;The Special Tuberculosis Treatment Information System (SITE-TB) arose mainly from the need to routinely monitor all persons with drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) in Brazil, as well as to qualify tuberculosis' drug control. Developed by the Professor Hélio Fraga Reference Center and the Management Sciences for Health/Brazil Project, this online system was implemented in 2013 in all Brazilian states. In addition to DR-TB, the system registers people with drug-sensitive tuberculosis with special regimen indications, and those with nontuberculous mycobacterial infections identified by differential diagnosis of tuberculosis. All confirmed tuberculosis cases should be notified on the Notifiable Diseases Information System (SINAN). In situations where treatment with special regimens is necessary, the case is closed on SINAN and notified on SITE-TB. Professionals from tuberculosis reference centers report and monitor these cases on the system, as well as manage tuberculosis' drugs.

686;"OBJECTIVE: to describe the temporal and geographical expansion of Zika virus (ZIKV) circulation in countries and territories, from the time it was first isolated until 2018. METHODS: This was a non-systematic literature review covering the period from 1947 to 2018 using the MEDLINE database and World Health Organization estimates. RESULTS: Since its isolation in 1947, ZIKV circulation spread through Africa, Asia and the Pacific before reaching the Americas in 2013, causing serious clinical manifestations; the highest seroprevalence rates were recorded in Yap (74%) and in Brazil (63%); genetic mutations, absence of immunity and high vector susceptibility may have influenced ZIKV transmissibility and help to explain the magnitude of its expansion. CONCLUSION: The spread of ZIKV circulation in the Americas was the most extensive recorded thus far, possibly as a result of population and geographical characteristics of the sites where the virus circulated."
687;"OBJECTIVE: to investigate socio-demographic factors associated with non-use of condoms, and to describe the prevalence of sexually transmitted infections (STI) in rural communities of Ouro Preto, Minas Gerais, Brazil, 2014 to 2016. METHODS: data were gathered from individual interviews and rapid tests were performed; associations were tested using Poisson regression, with a 95% confidence interval (95%CI). RESULTS: we detected 3.8 cases/10,000 inhabitants for hepatitis B and syphilis, and 1.3 cases/10,000 inhabitants for hepatitis C; no HIV cases were detected; in the multivariate analysis we found higher prevalence rates of condom non-use among the group of individuals who were married, had common law partners or were widowed (PR=1.20 - 95%CI 1.06;1.36). CONCLUSION: individuals in a stable relationship formed the group with the highest prevalence rate of condom non-use; new syphilis and viral hepatitis cases were detected using rapid tests during the survey."
688;OBJECTIVE: to analyze spatial distribution of avoidable infant deaths in Espírito Santo state, Brazil, 2006-2013. METHODS: this was an ecological study of infant deaths recorded on the Mortality Information System and classified according to the method used by the International Collaborative Effort on Perinatal and Infant Mortality (ICE). Avoidable death rates were calculated and smoothed by global and local Bayesian estimators. Local Moran's Index was used to verify local spatial correlation. RESULTS: of the 5,089 deaths, 4,805 were classified as per ICE, 77.2% of which were avoidable. The crude mean rate was 9.68/1.000 live births, reducing to 8.96/1.000 live births after applying the global Bayesian estimator. The municipality of Jerônimo Monteiro had the highest rate (20.1/1.000 live births). The Local Moran's Index showed weak spatial correlation of 0.197 (p-value=0.02). CONCLUSION: there were clusters of municipalities in the Central and Southern regions of the state, suggesting the need for adequate monitoring in these areas where there is a higher risk of avoidable deaths.
689;"OBJECTIVE: to investigate access to health services for tuberculosis (TB) diagnosis and treatment among indigenous peoples in Rondônia State, Brazil, 2009-2011. METHODS: we conducted a cross-sectional study with indigenous people attending Indigenous Health Care Units (Casai) between October 2009 and February 2011; geographical, economical and functional dimensions of access to TB services were evaluated through interviews and then described. RESULTS: 52 indigenous people with TB were interviewed; in the geographical dimension, lack of transportation, distance and lack of health professionals were the main obstacles; in the economic dimension, 15 indigenous people reported cost/expense as a barrier to access; in the functional dimension, 21 arrived at the Casai using their own means; 24 reported that the time between first symptoms and arriving at the Casai was > 30days; 25 reported that time between first consultation and starting treatment was >30 days; treatment was supervised in 22 cases. CONCLUSION: the difficulties found in accessing health services in the dimensions we analyzed can contribute to TB continuing to be transmitted in indigenous villages."
690;"OBJECTIVE: to analyze lung cancer mortality trends in Brazil, 2000-2015. METHODS: this was a time series study; lung cancer death records were corrected; linear autoregressive models were used to calculate regression coefficients (β1) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) in trend analysis according to sex, in the 30 and over age group, for 19 metropolitan areas (MAs) and the interior regions of 14 Brazilian states; positive β1 indicates upward trends while negative β1 indicates downward trends. RESULTS: increases were found in males from interior regions of North and Northeastern Brazilian states, especially in Rio Grande do Norte state (β1=1.03 - 95%CI0.47;1.58); downward trends were also found in males, notably in the Porto Alegre MA (β1=-2.55 - 95%CI-2.79;-2.31); the highest increase in females was found in the interior of Ceará state (β1=0.86 - 95%CI0.79;0.92). CONCLUSION: differentiated patterns according to location and sex were revealed; cancer control measures should be considered above all for women and the interior regions of Brazil."
691;"OBJECTIVE: to describe updating of stratification of the Brazilian municipalities in order to evaluate health performance. METHODS: this was a descriptive and methodological study with stratification of municipalities according to population size and conditions influencing health management, using data from the intercensal period (2015) and showing classification variations compared with the census period (2010); the original data on demographic characteristics, funding capacity and population purchasing power were adjusted for the year 2015 based on a baseline study conducted with census data. RESULTS: some 15% of the municipalities were reclassified in the intercensal period, with the main factors of change being the conditions influencing health management. CONCLUSION: the need for intercensal updating of this form of classification was confirmed, given that the socioeconomic conditions of the municipalities vary in the five-year period; Primary Health performance evaluation should consider updated stratifications that include management conditions for the purpose of classification."

776;Objective To know the opinion of adolescent school smokers about smoking cessation counseling and treatment, and to investigate whether negative opinion was associated with lack of motivation to stop smoking. Methods This was a cross-sectional study carried out in Goiás state, Brazil, with an intentional sample of adolescent students, in 2018. Poisson regression was used. Results One hundred and thirty adolescents took part. Most of them expressed a positive opinion on the three smoking cessation interventions surveyed: medical counseling (76.2%), dental counseling (70.0%), and smoking cessation treatment (66.2%). Negative opinions were more frequent among adolescents who were not motivated to stop smoking (p<0.05). Regression analyses revealed that lack of motivation to quit smoking was associated with a negative opinion about each intervention. Conclusion The adolescents had a positive opinion about counseling and treatment for smoking cessation in health services. Negative opinion was associated with lack of motivation to quit smoking.
777;"Objective To describe the characteristics of female sex workers (FSW) in 12 Brazilian cities. Methods This was a cross-sectional biological and behavioral surveillance study with FSW recruited by respondent-driven sampling (RDS) in 2016. HIV prevalence, sociodemographic, behavioral and sex work profession variables were estimated by city. The chi-square test was used to compare these distributions. Results Among 4,328 FSW, HIV prevalence was 5.3% (95%CI 4.5;6.3), ranging from 0.2% (95% CI 0.0;1.2), in Campo Grande, to 18.2 (95%CI 13.2;24.7) in Salvador. In half of the cities, HIV prevalence in the samples was >5.0%, while Campo Grande, Brasília and Belo Horizonte had prevalence rates <1.0%. Significant differences between cities were found in distributions according to educational level, income, workplace, age sex work started, and illicit drug use.

786;Objective To describe the clinical and epidemiological profile of primary thyroid cancer hospital cases in Brazil. Methods This is a descriptive study of cases held on hospital cancer records who had their first consultation for treatment in the period 2000-2016 and who were monitored by the hospitals providing those records. Results Of the 52,912 cases, 83.4% were female and 96.9% were differentiated carcinoma cases. The median time to diagnosis was shorter for anaplastic cases (11 days) and for those living in Brazil's Southern region (5 days). Treatment was initiated within 60 days in 88.8% of cases that arrived at the hospitals without diagnosis and in 34.9% of those who arrived with diagnosis. Conclusion The findings are consistent with thyroid cancer epidemiology, with a predominance of female cases and differentiated carcinomas. Analysis of time-to-treatment suggests access difficulties for those who already had diagnosis when they arrived at the hospitals.
